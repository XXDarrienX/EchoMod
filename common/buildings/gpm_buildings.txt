# Do not remove or rename this

# Possible Variables for Buildings:
# strategic_resource: strategic resource, deprecated, strategic resource used by the building.
# allow: trigger to check for allowing construction of building.
# prerequisites: Tech requirements for building.
# empire_unique: boolean, can only build one if set to true.
# cost: resource table, cost of building.
# is_orbital: boolean, can only be built in orbital station.
# modifier: modifier, deprecated, applies a modifier to planet; use planet_modifier instead.
# planet_modifier, country_modifier, army_modifier: applies modifier to planet/country/armies
# triggered_planet_modifier = { key (optional), potential (scope: planet), modifier }: applies conditional modifier to planet
# base_buildtime: int, number of days for construction.
# requires_pop, boolean, building will require a pop for production.
# required_resources, resource table, required resources for production.
# produced_resources, resource table, produced resources in production.
# upgrades, buildings list, buildings this building can upgrade into.
# is_listed, boolean, toggles if this building is shown in the non-upgrade buildable list.
# planet_unique, toggles if one can build multiple of this type on a single planet.
# ai_weight, weight for AI, default is set to one, weight set to 0 means that AI will never build it
# is_colony: trigger to check if the building is a colony shelter for country (scope: country, from: planet). default: "always = no"
# active: trigger to check if a building can be active with a given pop worker (scope: pop) if you add a trigger here, you should also add the requirements in the description
# show_tech_unlock_if: trigger to show this building only conditionally in the technology screen. scope: country. default: { always = yes }
# planet_modifier_with_pop_trigger = { key (optional), potential (scope: pop), modifier }: applies modifier to pops on planet that satisfy condition in trigger
