It seems clear now that the Dessanu were some kind of advanced nanite life form. Archival computer logs recovered from the wreckage of the factory sheds some light on this mystery:\n\nThe L-Cluster WAS inhabited by a civilization that called itself the Dessanu at some point. They created a new strain of nanomachines that helped them in the construction of their galactic Gateway network. For unknown reasons, the Dessanu recalled these nanites to the L-Cluster and attempted to deactivate them. When this failed, they sealed themselves in with the nanites by disabling the L-Gates.\n\nThe logs end here, but there is evidence that some kind of titanic struggle raged in the cluster afterwards. Presumably, the nanites won and then eventually chose to mimic the Dessanu for some reason. They rebuilt the Dessanu civilization as it appeared at the time of its destruction, and were apparently content to continue this charade even after the L-Gates were reopened."
