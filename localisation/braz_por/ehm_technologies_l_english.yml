 ### Engineering
 # Drones specialisation
 tech_powered_exoskeletons_hive_mind:0 "Mining Drones"
 tech_powered_exoskeletons_desc_hive_mind:0 "Not all our drones are suited to extract minerals. Only the strongest are sufficient enough. Our Mind will make sure that specialised drones will be used in our mines, and some of them can even be integrated in our armies."
 # Armies
 tech_assault_armies_hive_mind:0 "Assault Drones"
 tech_assault_armies_desc_hive_mind:0 "We can't simply throw drones at a planet and expect it to fall. It takes a little more preparation than that."
 tech_drop_pod_hive_mind:0 "Transport Eggs"
 tech_drop_pod_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our assault drones cannot survive in outer space. Our Hive will grow thick and nutrients-filled eggs to carry our assault armies before their assault."
 tech_planetary_defenses_hive_mind:0 "Defense Drones"
 tech_planetary_defenses_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our Hive always had to fight in order to survive and thrive. Now that we venture into space, the risks and rewards are only bigger. The resources we put into our defense, be it in specialized drones or planetary defenses, must be bigger too."
 # Outerspace Stations
 tech_space_construction_hive_mind:0 "Offworld Building Drones"
 tech_space_construction_desc_hive_mind:0 "Building a station in space is not the same task as building it on our homeworld. We need special drones, able to withstand the extreme environments of space."
 tech_space_defense_station_improvement_hive_mind:0 "Defense Platforms Sub-Units"
 tech_space_defense_station_improvement_desc_hive_mind:0 "As the need for stronger defense platforms arises, we will grow small and very specialised sub-units just for these. This should make building these defense platforms easier, as the sub-unit will handle it, and their maintenance cheaper, as our Mind won't have to do it by itself."
 
 ### Physics
 # Colonisation speed
 tech_cryostasis_1_hive_mind:0 "Nesting Drones"
 tech_cryostasis_1_desc_hive_mind:0 "If we grow highly-specialised drones, whose only goal is to quickly form a new nest, and put them into our nesting ships, we will be able to incorporate new planets into the Hive far more quickly."
 tech_cryostasis_2_hive_mind:0 "Hive Sub-Unit Incorporation"
 tech_cryostasis_2_desc_hive_mind:1 "It was previously impossible to carry a whole sub-unit into a ship, forcing us to let it grow on its planet. But if we could make it on a already-grown planet, and let it become mature in the ship, we will gain very precious time when colonizing new planets."
 # Systems surveying
 tech_automated_exploration_hive_mind:0 "Exploration Drones"
 tech_automated_exploration_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our exploration ships still need to be controlled directly by the Mind. This can cause some inefficiency, especially as we need our Mind to be focused on other things. Let us grow new exploration drones, whose task will be to guide exploration ships."
 
 ### Society
 # Capital expansion
 tech_planetary_unification_hive_mind:0 "Planetary Unification"
 tech_planetary_unification_desc_hive_mind:0 "A single Mind and a single Voice must control our worlds. Other emergents Hive Minds have to be assimilated, and non Hive-Minded species won't stand in our way."
 tech_planetary_government_hive_mind:0 "Sub-Unit Deployment"
 tech_planetary_government_desc_hive_mind:1 "Once we take control of a new nest, we need to make sure the Mind's will can reach it. Growing a Hive's sub-unit, a collection of highly-specialised drones, directly linked to the Mind and applying its will on the planet, is a necessary step in the deployment of a new colony."
 tech_colonial_centralization_hive_mind:0 "Sub-Unit Specialisation"
 tech_colonial_centralization_desc_hive_mind:1 "Each of our sub-units must be adapted to the needs and resources of its world."
 tech_galactic_administration_hive_mind:0 "Mind's Galatic Ambitions"
 tech_galactic_administration_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our Mind has evolved and changed quite a lot since it took control our world. But it needs to become even stronger. We can't be satisfied with only a handful of planets. We will become a galatic power."
 # Leader numbers and pool
 tech_adaptive_bureaucracy_hive_mind:0 "Evolution Of The Mind"
 tech_adaptive_bureaucracy_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our Mind did not truly change since it awoke. But the needs of the Hive did. Our Mind must evolve, or it will become inefficient."
 tech_living_state_hive_mind:0 "Semi-Autonomous Drones"
 tech_living_state_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our Hive grew much more than what we expected. It is not a problem in itself, at least not yet, but it requires the growth of new and more semi-autonomous drones, able to lead worlds, armies, fleets, or research units."
 tech_collective_self_hive_mind:0 "Delegated Autonomy"
 tech_collective_self_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our Mind has so much to focus on that it can become difficult to lead everything perfectly. Our drones need more adapted leaders, but we will make sure that none of them can leave the Hive."
 # Core systems cap
 tech_colonial_bureaucracy_hive_mind:0 "Sub-Unit Integration"
 tech_colonial_bureaucracy_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our sub-units are theorically directly linked to the Mind, but we can only control so much of them before having to delegate to higher-level sub-units. For our own sake, the Mind must be able to control more of them."
 tech_galactic_bureaucracy_hive_mind:0 "Mind's Reach"
 tech_galactic_bureaucracy_desc_hive_mind:0 "Even the sub-units on the other side of the galaxy must be linked to the Mind."
 # Genetic manipulation
 tech_genome_mapping_hive_mind:0 "Genome Mapping"
 tech_genome_mapping_desc_hive_mind:0 "Genetic knowledge will allow our Mind to have an easier time taking care of its drones."
 tech_cloning_hive_mind:0 "Mass Drone Replication"
 tech_cloning_desc_hive_mind:1 "Instead of growing our drones one by one, we should mass produce them using cloning technologies. This will make filling our worlds with our drones quicker."
 tech_morphogenetic_field_mastery_hive_mind:0 "Psionic Control"
 tech_morphogenetic_field_mastery_desc_hive_mind:1 "For centuries, our Mind tried to expand its influence on other species. Recent breakthroughs allow us to temporarely control incredible beasts, which we can then use at our advantage."
 # Growing Nests
 tech_frontier_health_hive_mind:1 "Growth Pools"
 tech_frontier_health_desc_hive_mind:1 "Using special pools, composed of highly-energetic nutrients, to grow our drones can be far more effective than relying on an hostile environment."
 tech_frontier_hospital_hive_mind:1 "Hive Nest"
 tech_frontier_hospital_desc_hive_mind:1 "The pools we previously grew are a good step in the right direction, but need to be adapted to the most local variations of environment. Tying them to the local sub-unit will make sure of that."
 # Armies
 tech_defense_army_hive_mind:0 "Defense Drones"
 tech_defense_army_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our Mind may be alone in the universe, but if we are not, we have to be cautious. Unknown species may want to take seize our worlds. We will be ready."
 tech_combat_training_hive_mind:0 "Drones Armies"
 tech_combat_training_desc_hive_mind:1 "Specialisation of drones units, suited only for combat, will make them more resilient and less susceptible to attrition, training losses, and real fights related deaths. That should make supporting them easier."
 # Local Fauna Usage
 tech_alien_life_studies_hive_mind:0 "Pre-Sapient Protection Zones"
 tech_alien_life_studies_desc_hive_mind:1 "Sapient species tend to tell us what they need and want, most of them can quite easily communicate with us, making their protection easier. But pre-sapient species cannot. And yet, they need to be protected."
 # Leaders Genetic Alteration
 tech_selected_lineages_hive_mind:0 "Semi-Autonomous Drones Reintroduction"
 tech_selected_lineages_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our Mind has to grow all the semi-autonomous leaders we need. It allows them to be flawlessly bound to the Mind, but can make their genetic content lost upon their inevitable death. If we were to allow some of them to pass on their genetic information, by reintegrating it to the Hive before growing a new leader, we could get new and more reliable leader drones."
 tech_capacity_boosters_hive_mind:0 "Leaders Genetic Codex"
 tech_capacity_boosters_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our Mind will remember the exact genetic content of every leader it grows. That way, we will be able to carefully grow nearly-perfect semi-autonomous drones."
 # Specialized sub-units (unique buildings)
 tech_galactic_markets_hive_mind:0 "Galactic Trading Sub-Unit"
 tech_galactic_markets_desc_hive_mind:0 "Trade was something we never even had a concept of until we lanched our first drones towards the stars. Empires composed of individuals instead of drones, on the other hand, have done it for hundreds or thousands of years. We should learn from them."
 tech_global_research_initiative:0 "Research Sub-Unit"
 tech_global_research_initiative_desc:0 "Our Mind has to constantly discorer new things, new ways to expand its reach, new worlds to grow new nests on. If we were to dedicate an entire sub-unit just to scientific advancement, our Mind would be free of this burden to focus on other things."
 # Unity generation
 tech_cultural_heritage_hive_mind:0 "Sub-Unit System"
 tech_cultural_heritage_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our Mind's reach is still fragile. We need to grow big and expensive sub-units to enforce our will on other planets. If we were to grow nodes, used to strengthen the psionic bound between our Mind and the sub-unit, the abilities of both would be enhanced."
 tech_heritage_site_hive_mind:0 "Planetary Hive Link"
 tech_heritage_site_desc_hive_mind:0 "The will of the Mind can reach all the planets we control, but if we were to grow a Hive Link on our planets, its psionic signal would be far stronger.."
 tech_hypercomms_forum_hive_mind:0 "Local Self Reflection"
 tech_hypercomms_forum_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our Mind is not perfect. Or at least it could do better. Knowing that, we can self-reflect on a sub-unit levels to make them even closer to the Mind."
 tech_autocurating_vault_hive_mind:0 "Reflective Wonder"
 tech_autocurating_vault_desc_hive_mind:0 "The will of our Mind reaches even the furthest of stars, or the most isolated planets. But what about closer places ? What about ... Itself ?"
 # Colonization and planet's habitability
 tech_colonization_1_hive_mind:0 "Nest Ships"
 tech_colonization_1_desc_hive_mind:0 "Reaching and colonizing new worlds is not an easy task. The drones we have to send cannot go there by themselves. They require a specialised ship, which we will have to grow ourselves. The stars and their habitable worlds will open their arms to our collective."
 tech_colonization_2_hive_mind:0 "Atmosphere Adaptation"
 tech_colonization_2_desc_hive_mind:1 "Adapting our drones to the local conditions is an important step in the colonization of new worlds. Both the buildings grown on new worlds, and the drones living inside them, will have their respiratory system slightly modified to better suit the local atmosphere."
 tech_colonization_3_hive_mind:0 "Hostile Environment Adaptation"
 tech_colonization_3_desc_hive_mind:1 "Other factors must be taken into account when choosing a new world : Temperature, amount of liquid we require, already present species, and so on. During its growth, the sub-unit will analyze and adapt to these local variations, and make sure that its drones follow these adaptations."
 tech_colonization_4_hive_mind:0 "Feeding Nest Adaptation"
 tech_colonization_4_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our feeding nests may sometimes fail to provide enough food for our drones, buildings, and armies, due to the local soil composition. Small genetic alterations will make sure that no matter the soil, the nest will be able to sustain the colony."
 tech_colonization_5_hive_mind:1 "New Climates Adaptation"
 tech_colonization_5_desc_hive_mind:2 "Our species evolved on our homeworld, and as such has quite a hard time living on a completely different environment. Our Mind identified some of the genetic material required to make sure that our drones will thrive no matter their environment."
 tech_tomb_world_adaption_hive_mind:0 "Damaged Worlds Adaptation"
 tech_tomb_world_adaption_desc_hive_mind:0 "Some worlds have been heavily damaged by other species, either by its inhabitants through an inexplicable global civil war, or by a foreign invader not taking notes of the planet's inhabitants. The result is always the same, the planet is no longer suited for life. By understanding why, and how it can be countered, our drones will be able to grow on these inhospitable worlds."
 # Fleet organization
 tech_command_matrix_hive_mind:1 "Command Units"
 tech_command_matrix_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our Mind has to constantly monitor every single ship and the drones forming and living in it. To increase the efficiency of our fleets, the ways we use our psionic to issue orders and commands must be streamlined."
 tech_doctrine_navy_size_1_hive_mind:0 "Doctrine: Fleet Support"
 tech_doctrine_navy_size_1_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our fleets travel further than they ever did, and their needs are only increasing. We will grow dedicated outposts to take care of that."
 tech_doctrine_navy_size_2_hive_mind:1 "Doctrine: Support Drones"
 tech_doctrine_navy_size_2_desc_hive_mind:1 "As our fleets go beyond our borders for extended periods of time, static outposts aren't enough. Support drones, overgrown parts of the Hive existing to be consumed by our vessels, will be deployed."
 tech_doctrine_navy_size_3_hive_mind:0 "Doctrine: Interstellar Logistics"
 tech_doctrine_navy_size_3_desc_hive_mind:0 "By giving to our fleet dedicated sub-unit the localisation of every outpost and support drone, they can use their semi-autonomy to take care of the needs of the swarm without relying on the Central Mind"
 tech_doctrine_navy_size_4_hive_mind:0 "Doctrine: Fleet Liasions"
 tech_doctrine_navy_size_4_desc_hive_mind:0 "Every fleet has to communicate through the Mind, making coordination between several swarms difficult. By allowing them to bypass the psionic link, we can greatly enhance their efficiency."
 # Army organization
 tech_ground_defense_planning_hive_mind:0 "Defense Drones Organization"
 tech_ground_defense_planning_desc_hive_mind:0 "Having Defense Drones to protect our worlds is a necessity. But by organizing both our buildings and drones centers, as well as the position of the defense drones and their growing centers, we will be able to shield our Hive from external threats with less lost biomass."
 tech_global_defense_grid_hive_mind:0 "Defense Drones Evolution"
 tech_global_defense_grid_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our Defense Drones are still more suited for threat living on our world or that we already encountered. By constantly growing new forms of them, even if they are not always necessary or even viable, would allow us to quickly react to any new threat. But it would also require some more space, so we would have to grow new defense drones nests."
 # Expansion
 tech_galactic_ambitions_hive_mind:1 "Stellar Expansion"
 tech_galactic_ambitions_desc_hive_mind:3 "Our Mind dreams of reaching new stars and uncharted systems. And our Hive will make it a reality."
 tech_manifest_destiny_hive_mind:0 "Manifest Destiny"
 tech_manifest_destiny_desc_hive_mind:1 "We have to assert our place among the stars. That is what our Hive was meant to."
 tech_interstellar_campaigns_hive_mind:0 "Interstellar Expansion"
 tech_interstellar_campaigns_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our Hive has to grow. If it means taking already claimed systems, so be it, our drones will learn how to use the existing stations."
 tech_galactic_campaigns_hive_mind:0 "Galactic Campaigns"
 tech_galactic_campaigns_desc_hive_mind:0 "As our Hive conquers new stars, it become increasingly difficult to keep track and maintain a strong psionic bound to all of them. By reinforcing this link our Hive can maintain its grasp on these systems, and can more effectively claim and rightfully get new ones."
 # Ascension Perk
 tech_ascension_theory_hive_mind:0 "Perpetual Evolution"
 tech_ascension_theory_desc_hive_mind:0 "Our Hive Mind changed in all its most fundamental aspects since we took the full control of our homeworld. Contrary to other organics, we did not experience internal fractures, or 'cultural shifts'. But we still had to adapt and evolve. If we could look at our past, and try to predict the future, we could understand the very fabric of this evolution, and use it at our own advantage."

 # Leaders
 tech_repeatable_reduced_leader_cost_hive_mind:0 "Semi-Autonomous Drones Management"
 tech_repeatable_reduced_leader_cost_desc_hive_mind:1 "When we grow a new leader drone, we need to make sure of two things : That it can do its job, and that it does not become too much independant, else it will become useless and potentially crazy. Our Mind will carefully explore the limits of both these options."
 tech_repeatable_improved_leader_cap:0 "Semi-Autonomous Leaders Management"
 tech_repeatable_improved_leader_cap_desc:1 "Our Mind first developed semi-autonomous leaders to take care of fields it could not always focus on. It proved effective, but since we took control of our homeworld, our needs changed. Let us make sure that we will always have enough of these semi-autonomous drones."
 # Sectors
 tech_repeatable_improved_sector_cap_hive_mind:0 "High-Level Sub-Units Focus"
 tech_repeatable_improved_sector_cap_desc_hive_mind:1 "Our Mind cannot control every single one of our sub-units. We have to rely on higher-level and more autonomous sub-units."
 # Core Systems
 tech_repeatable_improved_core_system_cap_hive_mind:0 "Sub-Unit Integration"
 tech_repeatable_improved_core_system_cap_desc_hive_mind:1 "The psionic bound between the Mind and the sub-units can, in theory, reach them no matter their numbers or their distance from the Mind. In theory. Our Mind will focus on making this theory reality."
