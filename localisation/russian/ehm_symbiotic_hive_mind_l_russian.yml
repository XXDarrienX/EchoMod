 # Havoll Hive
 symbiotic_hive_mind_symbiosis.2.d:0 "We know that each of our drones are composed of two 'individuals' : A Lirvoll and an Havae. But how they came to be together, forming our species, the Havoll, was a mystery. Until now. Our genetic knowledge allow us to find answers we never thought we could one day consider.\nMillions of years ago, the Lirvoll and the Havae were two different species, living in their own environment - the Lirvoll on the shores of Hive's Core, and the Havae in its seas. It seems some Lirvoll were lucky enough to feed on some Havae, which led to an evolutionary race between the Havae, which only wished to be left alone, and the Lirvoll, who needed this source of energy. One of the examples of this evolutionary race was the capacity for the Havae to produce a chemical signal, allowing nearly-instantaneous communication with nearby Havae, to signal them that danger was nearby. However, one Lirvoll acquired this capacity too, after consuming an Havae, which led to a greater concentration of Havae near this Lirvoll, which could have been potentially disastrous. Over time, it evolved to also be able to call other Lirvoll, which seemed to form their first stables communities. But when one Lirvoll caught an Havae, both of which were capable of 'calling' nearby Havae or Lirvoll, and this Havae resisted the Lirvoll's attempts to consume it, managing to flee near its nervous system instead, where it was safe from the Lirvoll's internal defenses, and climbed slowly towards its brain, secreting an amount of Havaes' and Lirvolls' callers sufficient enough to modify the behaviour of both of the nearby species' individuals, the First Symbiotic was born, and our Hive Mind awoke.\n\nNow that we know how our species came to be, we can carefully change both the Havae's and the Lirvoll's signals receptors and emitters of what we know is the source of our psionic consciousness. This should make our symbiosis, which was a defensive surprise when our species fought each other, less agressive for both our Lirvoll and our Havae. Our entire Hive would benefit from it."
