A special one was given to the dictator, which was wirelessly connected to the Alpha Nexus, on Varnoll. They became an artificial Hive Mind." 
 qfts.16b:0 "What happened to Tesfin?" 
 qfts.16b.response:0 "Well you see, not everyone was found. A group of rebels led a revolution against the Hive. To escape the military drones, they fled to Tesfin, where they set up base. The Hive was already aggressively observing the primitives on the planet, known to us as the Flistonals. They recruited some primitives and taught them what to do, but the Shivkonian Hive had other plans. \n\nThey used a weapon, what can only be described as a Planet Killer, to obliterate the world. This was a massive setback for the resistance. Luckily for them, some other rebels took control of Poldan already." 
 qfts.16c:0 "Why is Niten... the way it is?" 
 qfts.16c.response:0 "It may seem like an infection to your kind, but it was considered a paradise by the Hive Mind. Not only that, it was rendered completely inhabitable for any other species. It was the capital of the Shivkonians. You may not have noticed, but there is little to no life on the planet now. \n\nAlthough it has been a long time, the planet was, in a way, destroyed. The Planet Killer that was used against is was now used against them. We had our own design, but the main difference was that we were humane. We did not want to destroy our old home, so we used the power of neutrons. The entire planet was swept by a wave of neutrons, and any living thing was killed." 
 qfts.16d:0 "What is the military complex on Varnoll?" 
 qfts.16d.response:0 "Oh, that's Alpha Nexus. It was the core of the Hive, which kept the brain implants working and connected to the main one. It was later repurposed as a military base to fight the rebellion. Soon, the enemy Planet Killer was getting ready at the base, to destroy Poldan. However, we had an advantage. My people had a remote control, which could deactivate the Hive. As soon as the killer got in orbit, I would flip the switch to destroy the Hive. Well, I wouldn't flip it though; there were too many allies on Varnoll. But they didn't know that. \n\nLittle did we know, the base on Varnoll had another weapon. They covered the entire world in a shield; nothing could get in. \n\nNothing could get out." 
 qfts.16e:0 "What happened after that?" 
 qfts.16e.response:0 "I do not know. \n\nBy that point, there were only pockets of rebels on Niten. We had no hope. At the same time, chaos fell upon Poldan. Many died, few survived, but just barely. It is clear that the Shivkonian Hive eventually fell, but how that came to happen, I don't know."
