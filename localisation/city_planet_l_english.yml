 cartel.1.desc:0 "It seems that our urban planning has led to unfortunate side-effects. Drug lords have been banding together in the seedy underbelly of our ecumenopolis. We now have fully-functional drug cartels on our hands. This, clearly, could become a major problem. We must lower the unrest on our ecumenopolis."

Assuming a population density of 7,698 people per square kilometer and a planetary surface area of 510,000,000 square kilometers, we can support a total population of about 3.92 trillion people. Assuming that an individual produces about 58.2 watts per per squre meter of skin, then 3.92 trillion people produce about 228 trillion watts of energy. This would heat the ecumenopolis to the point that it would be uninhabitable, were it not for huge advancements in heat sink technology discovered alongside FTL travel."
