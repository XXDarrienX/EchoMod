Naturally competitive and scheming, excelling at covert operations, they built their whole tribal civilization around what other species would consider illicit activies.\n\nThe most powerful criminal organization, the Guild of Spies, eventually grew to be the de facto governing body electing its leader from a faction of master assassins."

EMPIRE_DESIGN_jolnar_desc:0 "A soft-boned aquatic species, the Hylar are actually a collection of several sub-species, mainly derivative of the geographical and ocean depths from which they hail. A large bio-cerebral area of their physique, combined with a need to adapt their soft and slow bodies to their environment, created an evolution of material usage, as opposed to one of physical adaptation.\n\nDespite their physical weakness, the Hylar are a proud people, often to the point of abrasiveness and arrogance.

EMPIRE_DESIGN_nekro:0 "Nekro Virus"
EMPIRE_DESIGN_nekro_desc:0 "The nightmare creations known as the Nekro are the product of a single individual's obsession to create the perfect existential reality, a state-of-being that can only be described as a form of godhood.

EMPIRE_DESIGN_solfed:0 "Federation of Sol"

START_SCREEN_YSSARIL:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nRetillion had once been one of many farming colonies of the Lazax. The primitive but fiercely territorial Yssarils resisted the foreigners and fought back. Many were killed or enslaved but we learned quickly, adopting guerilla tactics and using their weapons against them.\n\nHoning our skills further we became masters of covert operations, building a reputation for ourselves among the other races. Yssaril operators and assassins from the Guild of Spies sold their talents to the highest bidder. With our newfound power and influence we were able to expel the Lazax from our planet. The Guild united the varied tribes and took over as the prime governing body of our people. Since the Lazax left, no off-worlder has been allowed on Retillion. Yet this did not stop the Twilight Wars from also engulfing the Yssaril Tribes.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work behind the scenes to push the Yssaril civilization to assume its rightful place in the galaxy and on the Imperial Throne."
START_SCREEN_SAAR:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nBut we are no strangers to tragic tales. For a long time our people have lead a nomadic existence, living among the other races. Most of our ancestors were shunned and forced to live in slums, working the most noxious and despicable industries. And everyone knew tales of more horrible fates such as the 'Lay of Lisis' which tells the story of a massacre of a whole planet at the hands of the Sardakk N'orr.\n\nA beacon of hope finally came in the form of Ragh Gavar. A simple freighter captain he became known for telling verses and tales to congregating Saar at his ports of call. Years after his apparent disappearance the Call started as every Saar began to feel within himself an unyielding longing for the stars, and especially for a certain distant place beyond known space. It was at this place where Ragh Gavar has crashed and prayed to the One Between the Stars for deliverance that we found our new home.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work among the clan elders to push the Saar civilization to assume its place in the galaxy that was denied to us for so long and maybe even make a claim for the Imperial Throne."
START_SCREEN_JOLNAR:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nThe Hylar of Jol quickly evolved from our aquatic roots to be masters of technology and knowledge. During the height of the Lazax Imperium, most technological devices had at least one or two components originating from our laboratories. This reliance on Jol Nar engineers and expertise was one of the key factors leading to the breakdown of galactic civilization during the Twilight years.\n\nWithdrawing into isolation at the onset of the Twilight Wars the rest of the galaxy faced technological failures while we suffered a massive economic downturn. An ill-planned war to attain desperately needed natural resources combined with an outbreak of the deadly Doolak plague brought us to the brink of annihilation. As cultures, economies, and finally the tools of war completely collapsed, the Twilight Wars quickly ebbed and the Dark Years began.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work among the scholars of the University to push the Hylar civilization to claim the Imperial Throne and usher the galaxy into an age of technological advancement and intellectual achievement."

Never scheming for power and territory, we alone saw the growing threat to the galaxy. Our elders fruitlessly sought to warn the Lazax and struggled to bring dialogue to the increasing factionalism.\n\nThe outbreak of the Twilight Wars caught us unprepared and weaponless. Only by brokering a deal and ceding our sister planet, Archon Tau, to one of the warring factions could we escape the fighting. But we, never fools, were aware that it only bought us time. So for the first time we created weapons and trained armies. In secret groves and hidden vales, our king sadly watched as his people developed into warriors. When the war finally arrived, the foreign installation on Archon Tau was hit hardest, with the whole planet being shattered beyond recall. But the Xxcha, now prepared, were able to weather the storm and survive.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work among the advisors to the king to push the Xxcha civilization to claim the Imperial Throne and finally bring peace and stability to the galaxy."

With the galaxy drowning in war and flames around us, the Symphony sang its perfect song as it has for millenia, a perfect cycle of life on our planet Nestphar. But then something disturbed the equilibrium. Some random piece from the outside world landed on our world. Digesting the music of the alien thing, new notes entered the Symphony.\n\nQuiet at first, but after centuries of resonating, it changed the tone of our music. A keen interest in colonization and expansion rose in the Symphony, together with subtle hints of duplicity and even aggression. As if remembering it from an old memory, we unveiled the secrets of space travel and the hyperspace roots. We will spread our spores to the galaxy and share the Symphony with all living things."
START_SCREEN_MUAAT:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nIt was during the early years of the Age of Dusk that Jol Nar explorers came upon our planet Muaat. They were amazed by the mineral wealth of our home but they were truly awestruck by the extraordinary qualities of its inhabitants. So it was that the planet's resources were exploited and we were pressed into slave labor. The Jol Nar Headmasters transformed the orbit of Muaat into a massive shipyard for the construction of a secret superweapon.\n\nWe suffered under the heels of the Jol Nar, but events of the early Twilight Wars would change our fortune. Greedily in the search for more deposits to exploit a Jol Nar expedition were infected by what became known as the Doolak plague. The plague became one of the greatest disasters of Jol Nar history, but it gave us the chance to finally carve our own destiny.\n\nHaving long schemed against our enslavers, we incinerated the remaining Jol Nar and captured their technology. We were resolved to never be enslaved again.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work among the Fire Wardens to push the Gashlai civilization to bring our fire to the furthest reaches of space and claim the Imperial Throne."
START_SCREEN_WINNU:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nThe Winnu were the first to seek annexiation into the empire. After suffering countless catastrophies we were on the brink of extinction when the Lazax came. They healed our scars and in turn, we adopted their code of strength and peace, the powerful doctrine which had allowed the first Lazax emperor to defeat the last of the mad Mahact kings and emerge as a shining beacon of peace and stability in a dark galaxy.\n\nEternally grateful, we swore an oath of servitude to the emperors. Disciplined and diligent, we became indispensible to the Lazax as bureaucrats, councilors and administrators. Without us, they would not have been able to hold their growing empire together. As the imperial seat was moved to Mecatol Rex, more than half the population of Winnu joined the Lazax diaspora to this new home. AS the ages came and went, most Winnarans began to think of Mecatol as their ancestral home, and the relevance and memory of Winnu and the brethren there diminished.\n\nThe Twilight Wars didn't distinguish between the Winnarans. As the great scourge eradicated the Lazax, we, as their closest allies, barely escaped that same fate. Most Lazax lore, wisdom and culture was destroyed, but some of it could be preserved on Winnu. In the centuries to follow the preservation of Lazax imagery, combined with our traditional traits of ambition, pride and impatience, instilled a sense of righteousness and superiority in our people.\n\nEven with most of that history forgotten, there are still a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work among the councilors to push the Winnu civlization to assume its rightful place and return true Lazax culture to the galaxy."
START_SCREEN_SARDAKK:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nThe Sardakk N'orr were always known for their strong warrior culture. Since time immemorial our Tekklar elite solders are trained exclusively in the southern polar regions, where the weak die and the strong become G'hom: members of the prestigious Tekklar order.\n\nOur militaristic tendencies could always be only barely contained under the Lazax's rule. At the onset of the Twilight Wars we jumped at the chance to ravage the homeworld of our former overlords. Yet in the end even our formidable military might could not carry us to victory and we fell into darkness like the other races.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work among the Veiled Brood to push the N'orr civilization to claim the Imperial Throne. As Quinarra slowly turns, as the stars again come into their right constellation, the Veiled Brood knows that the time to swarm is coming again. And this time, the swarm will cover the stars."

Although the planet itself was quite pleasant, its prisoner population was tortured, malnourished and pressed into military service.\n\nDuring the Twilight Wars, supply and supervision from the capital became infrequent and finally failed. The governor and wardens panicked and fled.\n\nRevolts and supply shortages made the first years of freedom difficult for our ancestors. A single human, Erwan Mentak, soon brought the different factions and races together in a final peace, and before he died, prosperity. Today, Moll Primus is governed by the Table of Captains, elected leaders from each region. Among them a single leader is granted the honorary title Erwan's Hand.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work among the captains to push the Mentak Coalition to exact their revenge on a galaxy that shipped our ancestors to torture and rot on Moll Primus centuries ago."
START_SCREEN_LETNEV:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nThe Letnev were always an ambitious and proud people. Our discipline and military culture brings only the strongest and smartest into positions of power. Our legendary troops are only surpassed in brute strength by the Tekklar N'orr legions of distant Quinarra. Throughout the time of the Lazax, the Letnev led two unsuccessful rebellions against the Imperium. This history of dissention served as justification for a constant imperial oversight and strict food and import controls.\n\nBut our ambition could not be contained. It was the Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole that ignited the Twilight Wars and the final downfall of the empire.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work to push the Letnev civilization to final dominance of the galaxy. Chief among them is the Baron himself, who has only one ambition: to become emperor at any cost."
START_SCREEN_NEKRO:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nOn the eve of the empire's fall, the Lazax councillor Ibna Vel Syd led a small contingent of his people on a secret exodus. Only with the help of increasingly extreme technological augmentation did they survive the early years of their exile. Eventually they would become the vast cybernetic civilization of the L1z1x. Just as they were readying themselves to make their bid on the Throne during the Twilight Wars, the madness of Mordai came.\n\nHe was the greatest of L1z1x enhancers, meticulous, inspirational and brazenly ambitious. On his quest for the perfect existential reality he didn't shy away from experimenting on himself. The smallest of software glitches in his latest cortex implant began to infect him with a recursive virus that changed his personality and instilled in him the belief that flesh, that biology, was holding back the aspirations of the L1z1x. By the time he and his cadre had been discovered their transformations into replicating nightmare machines was complete. Only after a five year civil war was the Nekro Virus defeated at great cost to the L1z1x.\n\nIt would mean a terrible fate for the galaxy if only a single piece of virus-infested orbital debris would have escaped during the schism. For then, the Nekro would be able to adapt and replicate again. And in their wake follows blackness and death."

Despite the undeniable historic universality in avoiding this region, few concrete explanations have been made as to the reason for such aversion. What is known for sure, is that Shaleri space has over time been responsible for an unusually high number of missing vessels. The mystery of the region goes further and deeper than just that of missing spaceships. there are records of strange equipment malfunctions, bad dreams and sudden illnesses.\n\nAll that time they were as unaware of us as we were of them. But recently we became more curious about the greater universe. Spurred on by the thought of a possible material galaxy beyond the Creuss anomaly and the danger it could pose to us, we developed the means to explore it."

Any dabbling in this field was severely punished.\n\nDarien van Hauge, a brilliant Sol scientist, who lost both his children to the terrible disease Greyfire, was intent of finding a cure for this horrible affliction. He secretly sought and finally acquired ancient Mahact bio studies. He and his wife Moyin, working in secret, made great advances. Word of his work began to leak and a congreagation of the hopeful began to surround him. When his activities were uncovered by the authorities, he was forced to flee with his wife and a few of his most devout followers. It was on the remote planet Lael, that they found refuge and happiness amidst a group of religious colonists.\n\nBut the happiness was shortlived as his wife developed Greyfire. Desperate to save her, he employed all his skills and forbidden knowledge, but still failed. Before her death, he extracted a single egg from her womb. In the following decades, Darien was able to clone and produce thousands of his 'sons', yet he was never able to eradicate the Greyfire disease from his creations, only its lethal outcome.\n\nThe Brotherhood, as we began to call ourselves, blessed with the brilliant minds of Darien and Moyin, grew to vast proportions and renamed our planet Darien.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work among the Blessed to push the Yin Brotherhood to bring Darien's legacy and the light of Yin to the Imperial Throne itself."

Then slowly we discovered an insatiable off-worlder lust for special products grown or manufactured by the craft and patient hands of the Hacan. Soon we became masters of trade and the Kenara system one of the most heavily trafficked in the known universe, apart from the wormhole portal systems. The desire to protect our newfound wealth and to peacefully arbitrate between the clans, moved us to form a representative gathering and elect the Quieron, a leader who speaks for all the clans.\n\nOur reliance on trade hastened our downfall during the Twilight Wars as every empire withdrew into itself.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work among the clan elders to push the Quieron to lead our people to the Imperial Throne, establishing an era of wealth and peaceful commerce."

Careful manipulation of the other races and memory-wiping the crews of stray ships helped us conceal ourselves. Through a secret relationship with the Yssaril Guild of Spies we were able to keep up technologically with the other empires.\n\nSoon after our appearance on the galactic stage, several of the great races, seeing a potential ally in us, sought to win our allegiance. After learning of our telepathic power and witnessing the strange arrogance of the Naalu, their quickly retrieved their envoys in a healthy fear of us. Standing isolated again we were dragged down by the fallout of the Twilight Wars.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten.

START_SCREEN_SOLFED:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nAfter the discovery of interstellar travel, humans have left Jord to explore the distant corners of space. During the height of the Lazax Imperium, humans represented the most numerous and most diverse species of the galaxy. It is commonly recognized that it has been our diversified skills that have been the determining factor in avoiding annihilation or extinction.\n\nAnd it was annihilation that we faced during the Twilight Wars. It was a Sol fleet that fired the first shot at the Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole, escalating a minor conflict into a full-scale galactic war. It was a Sol-led alliance that decapitated Lazax leadership in a daring strike on Mecatol Rex itself. But these early victories could not carry us to victory.\n\nToday, the Sol Federation of Nations is governed by the elected High Minister, who has the executive control of the economy, budget and Sol military. His executive powers are held in check by three distinct governing houses: the House of Law, the House of the People and the House of Industry. The four governing bodies of the Federation are all centrally located in the massive metropolis of New Moscow, a bustling center of politics, trade and high culture.\n\nThe history before the Dark Years is all but forgotten.

START_SCREEN_L1Z1X:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nThe L1z1x history started during the final days of the Lazax. It was councilor Ibna Vel Syd who foresaw the destruction of Mecatol Rex, but the emperor and his other councilors refused to listen. Refusing to share their fate, Ibna began secretly planning a furtive diaspora for his own family and the few thousand Lazax who shared his fears. With him, he sought to bring the pillars of Lazax culture, technology and knowledge. Then, on a fateful night during the 72nd year of the Twilight Wars, Ibna's ships left the spaceport of Mecatol City. Below them, the great Hall of Cartography burned, so fearful he had been of discovery and persecution by the Lazax's enemies.\n\nOn a cold planet orbiting the small star Hazz he found his secret destination. Struggling to survive, the last Lazax turned to cybernetic technology. Cybernetic augmentation crept into their lives and bodies, until they became indistinguishable from it. The L1z1x were born.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. Maybe only Ibna Vel Syd himself remembers, encased in eldritch technology that keeps his ancient body alive. Whether the L1z1x are guided by the wisdom that saved them or by the insanity that destroyed the famed Hall of cartography, only time will tell. Behind their vacant eyes lie both a tragic history and a terrible malevolence. It seems certain that the return of the Lazax will wash across the galaxy like a tide of prophecy and steel."
