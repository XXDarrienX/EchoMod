Several high-pitched roars echoed across the hive as the biological layer covering the incubation chamber ruptured and a thick, purple, ooze started leaking. Shortly afterwards the top of the hive started opening and several small creatures emerged from the chamber and flew straight towards the science team.

We have fully mapped out the fluid interactions of this world core.\nThe data suggest that around the dense metal core there is not one but two distinct layers of molten rock and minerals. The first, inner, layer seems to behave as normal, flowing against the dense metal core and producing it's magnetic field. The fluid inner layer seems to move at the speeds we expect it to move. The outer molten layer however seems to flow in the opposite direction of the inner layer at a much slower speed.\nThis creates unique convection currents that keep them from over pressuring the tectonic plates and turning this world into a geological unstable nightmare."
