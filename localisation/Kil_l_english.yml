 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kilrathi_desc:0 "The Kilrathi are a cat like warrior race who inhabit the territories of the Empire of Kilrah. \n\ Kilrathi society is built upon honour and the strength of the individual. The society is incredibly class-based, with a nobility that holds absolute power over those below them.\n\ The necessity of responding to a challenge is an integral part of Kilrathi society. Any insult or challenge can be considered the grounds for a struggle to the death. It is, in fact, punishable by death for a warrior in the Kilrathi military to back down from single combat. Through challenge, the Kilrathi dominant/submissive relationship is established. \n\ Combat is a way of life for the Kilrathi, so don't expect to be friends."
