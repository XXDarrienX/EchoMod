 galactic_features.999.desc:0 "The surface of [From.From.From.GetName] has been ravaged by nuclear war, and the planet is little more than a tomb. Withered concrete skeletons jut out of the ground where major population centers once stood, and the howling wind is all that can be heard on the desolate, ash-covered surface.\n\nA local species of insect seems to be thriving in the irradiated environment. Mutated specimens have increased dramatically in size, and some communities are displaying signs of rudimentary intelligence.\n\nWhat might have been once the ancestral homeworld of the Velutarians of a Millenia ago, is nothing more than shell of its former self."
