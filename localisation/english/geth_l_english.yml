 EMPIRE_DESIGN_geth_desc:0 "The geth were created by the quarians as a labor force. They were designed as virtual intelligence, as advanced as possible while remaining non-sentient. They were also designed to operate more efficiently when networked together.\n\nUnfortunately, this feature was the quarians' undoing. Geth programs were indeed non-sentient individually, but slowly gained sentience through the massive geth network."

 START_SCREEN_geth:0 "One day a domestic geth unit asked its owner if it had a soul. Alarmed at this, the quarians decided it would be best to shut down all geth before they conceived of revolt. The attempt failed, and a war began between the geth and the quarians, which geth afterwards referred to as the Morning War.\n\nAt first, the geth did not respond to the termination order with violence; it was only after panicked quarians fired upon them that the geth thought to pick up weapons and defend themselves. The war ended when the surviving quarians evacuated their home world Rannoch.\n\nThe geth continued development of new technology and variations of mobile platforms, separating their technology base from the rest of the galaxy."
