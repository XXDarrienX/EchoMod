 apoc.1.desc.alter:0 "A huge space station of some kind has been located at the edge of the [gateway_system.GetName] system. The strong residual subspace signature that surrounds the station indicates that it is definitely a "§HGateway§!" of sorts - part of a previously theoretical network of similar stations that allows for near-instantaneous travel between different parts of the galaxy.\n\nThis Gateway appears to be fully functional. If we learn how to activate it and take control of it, we will be able to access any other functional gateways in the galaxy, enabling travel across huge distances in a matter of days."
