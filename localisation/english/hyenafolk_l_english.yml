 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hyenafolk1_desc:0 "Viverrokans are a nomadic species evolved from social mammals. Despite their carnivore diet, the Viverrokans' scavenger instincts have resulted in their societies developing with a distaste for direct violence. While their ruling planetary government is rife with deadly plots for supremacy, open war is perceived by most Viverrokans as an unnecessary risk. \n\n Evolving on a desert planet has granted this species a notable resistance and aptitude for recycling which they still make use of now that they have reached their interstellar age. \n\n Their homeworld, Kortomakon, was once a recollection of trading city-states, each competing for the few vital areas of the otherwise barren planet. These fractious societies have been brought together at the start of the XXI century with the creation of the Rising Throne, an intercontinental agreement between the most powerful merchant families of Kortomakon to peacefully handle the more sensitive trade disputes by appointing a permanent judge from the clergy, known as the Caliph. \n\n Although the position was initially meant to have only minimal powers, during the course of the following century a string of shrewd Caliphs managed to progressively centralize their authority, taking it away from the merchant lords. \n\n By the start of the XXIII century, the Caliph has become the sole ruler of Kortomakon, wielding tremendous spiritual and secular power and controlling the increasingly important star trade, which has been booming since after the discovery of the warp engine."

 hyenafolk_system_DESC:0 "A small binary system sustaining only a few barren worlds."
 START_SCREEN_HYENAFOLK:0 "For more than one hundred years the Rising Throne has prospered under the enlightened rule of wise Caliphs. \n\n By maintaining a monopoly over the warp drive, the Throne will ensure its dominance over the squabbling merchant lords of Kortomakon for centuries to come. \n\n No longer are we bound by the confines of gravity. For the first time in our entire history we can reach for the stars and search for new plentiful worlds where our children will grow numerous and wealthy. \n\n The first interstellar trade is about to be established!"
