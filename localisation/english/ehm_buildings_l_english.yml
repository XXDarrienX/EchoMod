 building_hive_food_stockage_1_desc:0 "As a Hive-Mind, we tend to use more food than other empires, as we need it to grow drones forming some of our buildings and armies. As such, we need to stockpile it. This dedicated place will be used to stock some of our food, to either feed our drones or grow new nests, and the psionic signal coming from it will make the drones working on nearby feeding nests more productive."
