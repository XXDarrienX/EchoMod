 ## Familiar World

 tf_legendsword.1.name:0 "A Familiar World"
 tf_legendsword.1.desc:0 "The establishment of our colony on [Root.GetName] has been a  resounding success, and our presence continues to spread throughout the galaxy. As our surveys continue of this planet, some teams are reporting that there seems to be strange similarities between certain geographical features on this planet and our homeworld. The most surprising report came from groups of historians that report that some of these similarities that are being reported, match descriptions that are found in ancient [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] texts. These texts have been mostly written off as either fantastical tales or moral lessons with no factual evidence of their events.\n\nThe [Root.Owner.GetName] Archaeological Society has submitted a request to carry out digs at a number of sites they have identified from our surveys of the planet to see what they can uncover."

 tf_archaeology_random.1000.name:0 "Archaeological Sites Discovered!"
 tf_archaeology_random.1000.desc:0 "On the surface of the planet, colonial surveyors have discovered a few sites that seem to be quite promising for future archaeological excavation. The mysteries that they may reveal about this planet and perhaps the universes has created widespread excitement in the scientific community."
 tf_archaeology_random.1000.a:0 "Excellent"

 tf_archaeology_random.1.name:0 "Ancient Burial Site"
 tf_archaeology_random.1.desc:0 "Though currently devoid of higher evolved life forms, [Root.Planet.GetName] seems to have once sustained a primitive civilization. Reports from the archaeological digs have indicated a great deal to how this society was organized from the elaborate burial rituals they have found scattered throughout the major continent. It seems that overall these civilizations did not make it past their equivalent of an Iron Age type development before a radical climate shift wiped them out. Regardless, the artifacts we have discovered shed light on the earlier stages of civilizational evolution and seem to confirm pre-existing theories, perhaps there is some universality to social development?"

 tf_archaeology_random.2.name:0 "Evolutionary Wonders"
 tf_archaeology_random.2.desc:0 "On this planet we have found a number of fossils that exhibit some remarkable evolutionary traits. Though, the findings are preliminary, they do point to the existence at one point in time to some very unique but strange evolutionary adaptations. These adaptations appear more or less at once in the fossil record and seem to just as all of a sudden disappear or become muted. Theories are already begin to circle around as to what could have caused this, but further biological work is required to find out for certain."

 tf_archaeology_random.3.name:0 "Memories of the Past"
 tf_archaeology_random.3.desc:0 "Teams of archaeologists have discovered on [Root.Planet.GetName] a number of well preserved underground complexes. Within these we have discovered a number of primitive, but in some cases still functional computing equipment. Further investigation has revealed an insight into the final moments of this civilization that was so close to achieving a sustained presence beyond the confines of this planet. As close as they were, their societal fabric began to disintegrate as severe environmental degradation fueled war and instability. In the end evidence points to the use of cataclysmic weapons by the great powers in a desperate attempt to retain control over their polities and to keep out the masses that would overburden the fragility of their own states.\n\nThese last journal entries and collected scraps of their written record have produced are hauntingly written."

 tf_archaeology_random.4.name:0 "Stone Age Ceremonial Sites"
 tf_archaeology_random.4.desc:0 "On [Root.Planet.GetName] we have discovered a number of sites that seem to date to a megalithic period, where society seems to have started to coalesce and giant stone monuments as well as the use of stone tools begins to be widespread. We have identified a number of these sites that were used for religious or even ceremonial purposes. Although, the people that have built these sites have long disappeared, and sapient life has disappeared on this planet. "

However, from the salvageable areas we have identified a couple of things: first, the technology that has been found here is way beyond our own, and second, initial dating results indicate that this is older than the fallen empires that we have encountered in thus far.
