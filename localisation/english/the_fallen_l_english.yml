 tf_black_orb_modifier_desc:0 "Flawless surface that is perfectly black, it does not reflect any light despite how smooth and frictionless the surface is. There seems to be a strange iridescent glow of light surrounding the orb, but only around its edge, it's indescribable. Those that stare at it too long obsess over the 'Emptiness' they experienced."
 tf_endless_shard_modifier:0 "Endless Shard"
 tf_endless_shard_modifier_desc:0 "A Shard of an unidentified material, with quantifiable dimensions, but something is not right when it is directly observed. The anomalous data that is recorded is undecipherable without any remote pattern. Those that observe it become catatonic, repeating the word 'Endless' over and over."

 tf_soul_crystal_modifier_desc:0 "There is nothing that our instruments can read that emanates from this object, and yet there is something indescribable about it. When near it a strange presence can be felt, it is at the same time an infinite number of beings each individual, and one single being. The experience is unnerving to say the least."

Strange though as upon closer examination these differences match up with descriptions from our own ancient texts that we had thought to be more fictional than historical accounts.

Interesting, the experience was so limited, so many minds that we did not have access too. How can a species live like this?

Due to incompatibilities with the parameters contained on the probe we were not able to enter the simulation, but through its deconstruction and the copies we have saved in our databanks, we have approximated the experience an organic consciousness would have as a result. Seemingly the beam is intended to cause an organic to experience the life of the creator of this probe during the final days of their civilization. A civilization doomed and still trying to leave some sort of mark on the galaxy, is an interesting allocation and use of resources. After completing it's transmission the probe has dropped its rudimentary shielding and exposing all internal databanks to radiation, eliminating any chance of repeating the transmission.
