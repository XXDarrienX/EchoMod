distar.65.akx.c:0 "What was, shall be. Their fate is out of our hands."
distar.185.mi.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has made some troubling finds on [From.GetName]. The planet's megaflora is not only widespread and gargantuan in proportion, but also predatory. Various species of carnivorous plants rest patiently on its surface, releasing aromatic lures into the air and waiting for prey to come near. Sensitive tendrils on the terminus of the plant's leaves register the approach of animals, resulting in the plants snapping shut around their hapless prey, which are left to be slowly corroded by digestive acids."
distar.3001.gc.desc:0 "Caution proved well in order. Hidden inside [trojan_asteroid.GetName] was a host of old mining drones programmed to attack on sight.\n\nAutonomous Science Drone [Root.GetLeaderName] fortunately detected this early and was able to jam the drones' sensors long enough to disable them.\n\nThe drones' cores are old indeed, but retain vast amounts of energy for siphoning."
distar.3003.gc.desc:0 "The events relating to asteroid [trojan_asteroid.GetName] has attracted the attention of our central processing network on [Root.Capital.GetName]. Our research drones has reacted with curiosity, posing questions as to why the drones were originally placed inside the asteroid.\n\nWere they guarding something?"
distar.3005.gc.desc:0 "As our research network hypothesized, the drones found in asteroid [trojan_asteroid.GetName] were indeed hiding something.\n\nThe valiant efforts of the [Root.GetName]'s crew have unearthed rich mineral deposits in the asteroid's core, previously obscured by the drones' presence."

anomalymod.1.name:0 "Recovered Tomb World"
anomalymod.1.desc:0 "The unusual radiation pockets appears to be the result of an ancient nuclear bombardment that wiped out [From.GetName]'s original population. Tens of thousands of years ago, [From.GetName] would have been a near-uninhabitable tomb world. In the intervening  millennium, however, the radiation has receded to nominal levels, allowing the planet's ecosystem to recover."
anomalymod.2.name:0 "Closed Wormhole"
anomalymod.2.desc:0 "The unusual readings of [From.GetName] appear to be consistent with similar readings of naturally occuring wormholes. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has theorized that [From.GetName] was once a wormhole, but the passage to the other side has since pinched off for unknown reasons. If true, studying [From.GetName] could greatly enhance our understanding of wormhole physics."
anomalymod.3.name:0 "Black Hole Merger"
anomalymod.3.desc:0 "The black hole in the [From.GetName] system is in fact two black holes that have merged together some time in the last few thousand years, an event so energetic that it's gravitational echos can still be felt today."
anomalymod.4.name:0 "Dark Matter Discovered"
anomalymod.4.desc:0 "The unusual gravitational readings of [From.GetName] have been traced back to an abundant source of §HDark Matter§!. This exotic substance seemingly defies several known laws of physics, leading to the unusual readings measured by the [Root.GetName]."
anomalymod.5.name:0 "Robot Miners"
anomalymod.5.desc:0 "Closer scans of [From.GetName] revealed that the abandoned structures were part of a massive abandoned mining operation. Interestingly, the facility was operated entirely by heavily specialized robotic workers. The machinery is no longer operating, but it is in good enough condition that the facility could theoretically be turned back on."
anomalymod.5.a:0 "Tear it apart and study the technology"
anomalymod.5.b:0 "Power on the facility"
anomalymod.6.name:0 "Mineral Processing"
anomalymod.6.desc:0 "The derelict structures on [From.GetName] are the remnants of an ancient mineral refinery. Materials brought up from long-collapsed mines were processed here into useful minerals. The mineral veins appear to have been exhausted long ago, but we can still study the technology of the facility itself."
anomalymod.7.name:0 "Rare Ores Discovered"
anomalymod.7.desc:0 "The derelict structures on [From.GetName] are the remnants of a long abandoned mine of rare minerals. Interestingly, scans indicate that the mines are still full of these rare ores, just waiting to be dug up. Why the mines were abandoned remains unknown."
anomalymod.8.name:0 "Friendly Wildlife"
anomalymod.8.desc:0 "Investigations into [From.GetName]'s wildlife revealed that the planet was once a colony of a race of small reptilians. This now extinct civilization had systematically engineered the native wildlife to be more hospitable to their fragile biology, and the docile wildlife we see today are the descendants of a massive genetic engineering program."
anomalymod.9.name:0 "Mycorrhiza Fungus"
anomalymod.9.desc:0 "The soil of [From.GetName] is host to an abundant mycorrhiza fungus living symbiotically with the planet's plant life. This fungus is extremely efficient at extracting nuitrients from the soil, allowing plant life to thrive beyond what would normally be expected."
anomalymod.10.name:0 "Calcified Worms"
anomalymod.10.desc:0 "Soil conditions on [From.GetName] are unusually poor in nuitrients, with some areas of the planet so deficient that nothing can grow at all. The cause can be traced back to a now extinct class of annelids that once lived on [From.GetName]. These large worm-like creatures tended to calcify on death, trapping nuitrients in their stony corpses. This lead to the poor soil conditions we see today, and inevitably causing their own extinction."
anomalymod.11.name:0 "Massive Worms"
anomalymod.11.desc:0 "[From.GetName] is home to massive worms living deep in the planet's soil. While the passage of these worms can be disruptive to life on the surface, the tunnels they leave behind provide easy access to the planet's mineral deposits."
anomalymod.12.name:0 "Pitharan Moon"
anomalymod.12.desc:0 "The unusually rich soil on [From.GetName] has, strangely enough, been traced back to dust from the planet's moon, [pitharan_moon.GetName]. [pitharan_moon.GetName] contains massive deposits of Pitharan Dust, a highly potent fertilizer, within in its crust. This dust will periodically be ejected by meteorite impacts and find its way to [From.GetName]."
anomalymod.13.name:0 "A Peculiar Star"
anomalymod.13.desc:0 "Science Officer [przybylski_star_leader.GetName] thought that [przybylski_star_leader.GetSheHe] had solved the mystery of [From.GetName]. [przybylski_star_leader.GetSheHeCap] had identified the star as an Ap class star, which is known to be lower in iron and higher in heavier elements than typical stars. However, more detailed analysis revealed that [From.GetName] contains many short lived elements, such plutonium and actinium, which should have decayed into lighter elements long ago.\n\nOur scientists have struggled to explain the findings from [From.GetName], with hypotheses ranging from the presence of undiscovered, even heavier elements, to contamination by an alien civilization. Science Officer [przybylski_star_leader.GetName] has prepared a special project to test the many hypotheses that have been put forth."
anomalymod.14.desc:0 "Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has discovered that the actinide elements found in [From.From.GetName] are in fact remarkably stable isotopes. [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] scientists have long hypothesized the existance of stable heavy isotopes, known as the 'Island of Stability,' but never before have such isotopes been observed in nature.\n\nNews of the discovery has sent shockwaves through our scientific community, and is expected to revolutionize our understanding of physics."
anomalymod.14.a.tooltip:1 "[From.From.GetName]:\n£physics  §G+9§!"
anomalymod.15.name:0 "Dissected Gateway"
anomalymod.15.desc:0 "The scattered remains above [From.GetName] are in fact remnants of a gateway that was deliberately and systematically dismantled, apparently in an attempt to learn how it functions. While the gateway is beyond all hope of repair, by establishing an orbital research facility above [From.GetName] we can get a clear picture of its inner working."

anomalymod.22.name:0 "[lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] the Friendly Space Amoeba"
anomalymod.22.desc:0 "It has long been a mystery why [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] is so friendly when her wild kin are so aggressive, but today our scientists have been able to make a breakthrough. One of our science officers noticed that [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] became unusually irritated when she came close to some ships testing out new prototype thrusters. The officer came to realize that the amoeba is sensitive to certain chemical's in the ship's exhaust. Even the exhaust of our standard ships contains irritants, although [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] appears to have developed a tolerance for them. Further investigation into this phenomena might reveal a way to pacify wild space amoebas."
anomalymod.22.a:0 "A promising discovery. Continue investigating."

anomalymod.41.name:0 "Brainslugs Revisited"
anomalymod.41.desc:0 "When the [Root.GetName] first discovered the brain slugs, we firmly rejected their offer of union. All evidence of their existance were covered up, and they became a state secret, known only to the highest levels of government. But those leaders of the past had not experience union with the brain slugs, like [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] has. Union is not something to be feared, and our people deserve a chance to make this decision for themselves, not made for them by a fearful government."

anomalymod.61.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Worship of the Dead God"
anomalymod.61.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed an unusual similarity in the local religions.\n\nIt seems that the locals have worshiped the remains of the gargantuan creature on the planet's moon as a god of death for generations beyond their remembrance. The locals believed that one day their god would rise from the dead, transforming into a deity of rebirth and ushering in a new era of prosperity for their people."
anomalymod.63.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Developing Psionics"
anomalymod.63.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed an unusual development.\n\nThe local populations of [the_planet.GetName] have recently begun to develop latent psionic powers. Our researchers are still unsure of the cause, but the development seems to have coincided with an increase in psychotropic chemicals released by the dead alien creature on the planet's moon.\n\nThe locals themselves appear to have attributed their newfound abilities as a boon granted to the faithful by their god of death. This almost universal belief has significantly impacted their cultural development."
anomalymod.65.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Transcendence"
anomalymod.65.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported a full psionic awakening among the local population seemingly overnight, leaving our scientists puzzled at how such an event could occur so quickly. The natives of [the_planet.GetName] have fully embraced their new powers, believing this to be a sign that their god of death will soon be reborn."
anomalymod.67.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: Moon Landing"
anomalymod.67.default.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported that the natives have managed to seend a manned mission to their moon. They chose as their landing site the corpse of the dead alien creature, which has great cultural significance to the locals. The mission was an unmitigated success, and the astronauts have made it safely back to their homeworld."
anomalymod.67.psionic.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported that the natives have managed to seend a manned mission to their moon. They chose as their landing site the corpse of the dead alien creature, which has great cultural significance to the locals. Strangely, when they arrived at the corpse, there was a flash of light, upon which the astronauts disappeared for several hours. Upon returning to their homeworld, there have been reports of the lunar explorers expressing previously undeveloped psionic powers, which the locals attribute as a gift from their god of death."
anomalymod.67.materialist.desc:0 "Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported that the natives have managed to send a manned mission to their moon. They chose as their landing site the corpse of the dead alien creature, which has great cultural significance to the locals. Upon inspecting the corpse, they we shocked to discover that corpse was indeed just a dead alien, and not the god of death that they had believed it to be.\n\nReports of the astronauts' discovery have already spread across [the_planet.GetName]. While some have come to accept these findings, many are in denial, some going as far as to claim that the entire lunar program was an elaborate hoax."
anomalymod.68.name:0 "Angry Gods"
anomalymod.68.desc:0 "There have been reports of an alarming number of mysterious injuries and death on [Root.GetName]. There is little that connects these events, except that they tend to occur most frequently near the native population. Due to their suspicious immunity to the recent misfortunes, the local authorities have fingered them as the likely culprits."
anomalymod.68.a:0 "Crack down on this before it gets worse."
anomalymod.69.name:0 "[Root.GetName]: Psionic Awakening"
anomalymod.69.desc:0 "Further reports from [Root.GetName].\n\nThe native population has undergone sudden and unexpected psionic awakening, seemingly overnight. Our scientists are at a loss to explain this sudden phenomena. The natives themselves have attributed their new powers as a boon from their god of death, to aid them in overthrowing thier oppressors - that is to say, us."
anomalymod.69.a:0 "What is going on?"
anomalymod.70.name:0 "Death God Awakens"
anomalymod.70.desc:0 "We have received a panicked report from [Root.GetName] that, while mostly incoherent nonsense, seems to indicate the belief that the dead creature on the planet's moon has stirred. While it would be easy to dismiss these reports as inane ramblings, not long afterwards we detected a massive psionic energy signature in the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System, followed by the loss of all contact with [Root.GetName] and the surrounding systems."
anomalymod.70.a:0 "What have we done?"
anomalymod.72.name:0 "Death God Awakens"
anomalymod.72.desc:0 "We have received strange reports coming from the [the_planet.solar_system.GetName] System. Visitors to the system have reported that the dead spaceborn alien on [the_planet.GetName]'s moon has 'awoken.' Scans of the system have confirmed a high concentration of psionic energy."
anomalymod.72.a:0 "What could this mean?"

anomalymod.80.name:0 "Bunker-Bot Research"
anomalymod.80.desc:0 "Further studies into the subterranean mega-computer's database have recovered partial logs that reveal new insights into the system's function. It appears that the system's original makers had discovered an unusual gateway that was severed from the rest of the gateway network - instead, the only valid destination is an uncharted group of stars just beyond our galaxy that has been designated the §HL-Cluster§!.\n\nAccording to the database, the gateway has been deliberately locked into some kind of maintenance loop that prevents its activation. The mega-computer appears to have been programmed to find a way to abort this process and open the gate. It is unclear how the computer's current calculations are related to its original task, if at all."
anomalymod.80.a.tooltip:0 "The closest L-Gate system will be automatically surveyed"
anomalymod.81.desc:0 "The long-forgotten subterranean mega-computer on [From.From.GetName] has recently broadcasted an message to an unknown recipient, the contents of which indicate that the computer has finally finished its calculations. It appears that the mega-computer was tasked with creating an analytical model of a system composed of trillions of nanobots, with particular interest in its aggregate behavior and structural stability. Analysis of these calculations have resulted in some exciting new findings that will undoubtedly aid us in our own research.\n\nThe mega-computer itself appears to be waiting for new instructions, presumably from the unknown recipient of its broadcast, and refuses to respond to any commands from our scientists."

anomalymod.86.name:0 "Exofungus Spreads"
anomalymod.86.desc:0 "The invasive exofungus on [Root.GetName] has aggressively spread into an unpopulated section of the planet. The fungus is now firmly entrenched, and a sustained effort will be needed to burn it back and reclaim that part of [Root.GetName]."

anomalymod.91.desc:0 "The local science team on [Root.GetName] studying the primitive wetwork computer has reported a breakthrough in their understanding of the device. Through selective seeding of nutrients, they have been able to achieve limited control over the patterns of the computer's algae. Unfortunately, compiling a full translation of the computer's interface is beyond what the local scientists are equiped for, and they have requested additional scientists and equipment to further their research."
anomalymod.92.desc:0 "Our scientists on [Root.GetName] have compiled a complete user manual for the wetware computer's operating system, allowing us to interact with it as with any other computer network. Although much of the computer's memory has been corupted, we can infer that the wetware computer was an experimental network built by a relatively advanced pre-ftl race that once lived on [Root.GetName].\n\nAlthough primitive by our standards, the computer makes up for this disadvantage through its massive size, and it could prove useful in aiding our research."

anomalymod.100.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have unfortunately remained unanswered. When the appointed moment arrived, nothing appeared to have occured. Further investigation revealed that the device had gotten stuck in the last several seconds of the clock's countdown."
anomalymod.100.a:0 "It will forever remain a mystery."
anomalymod.101.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, leaving behind more questions than answers. When the appointed moment finally arrived, the container began vibrating for several minutes, before falling silent. Further investigation revealed that the clock is now counting upwards."
anomalymod.101.a:0 "It was just a clock after all"
anomalymod.102.a.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, broadcasting a powerful signal directed at intergalactic space. After approximately an hour, the signal stopped, and the container collapsed into several pieces.\n\nAnalysis of the signal revealed a highly encrypted message. The content of this message, as well as the intended recipient, remains unknown."
anomalymod.102.b.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, broadcasting a powerful signal at seemingly empty space. After approximately an hour, the signal stopped, and the container collapsed into several pieces.\n\nAnalysis of the signal revealed a highly encrypted message. The content of this message, as well as the intended recipient, remains unknown."
anomalymod.102.c.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, broadcasting a powerful signal towards several remote sections of the galaxy. After approximately an hour, the signal stopped, and the container collapsed into several pieces.\n\nAnalysis of the signal revealed a highly encrypted message. The content of this message, as well as the intended recipient, remains unknown."
anomalymod.102.a:0 "What could it mean?"
anomalymod.103.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, glowing bright enough to wash out the signal from our remote sensors. When the light faded, the clock was gone, leaving faint traces of tachyon radiation in its wake."
anomalymod.103.a:0 "Where did it go?"
anomalymod.104.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have speculated wildly the purpose of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName], and now 23 years 3 days since its discovery, we have discovered a new development. Without warning, the clock began broadcasting a message on repeat in several different languages. We are unable to understand any of these languages, but the tone of the message seems urgent."
anomalymod.104.a:0 "We must translate this message!"
anomalymod.104.b:0 "It is not important"
anomalymod.106.desc:0 "We have been able to translate one of the languages being broadcast on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName], and the contents appear to be a dire warning. According to the message, the [atomic_clock_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System is the spawning ground for a massive, aggressive spaceborn entity known as a 'Spectral Wraith.' These powerful beings roam freely among the stars, and are more than capable of destroying entire fleets. The atomic clock was apparently synched with the spawning processes of these creatures, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] speculates that when the countdown runs out, another of these wraiths will appear."
anomalymod.106.a:0 "We must be prepared!"
anomalymod.107.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline, opening up and then... nothing. Further investigation revealed a hidden chamber that is unmistakably part of a powerful bomb: fortunately, the active substance of the bomb was removed long ago, rendering it inoperable."
anomalymod.107.a:0 "What a close call!"
anomalymod.108.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline. Unfortunately, as some had feared, the clock was in fact a bomb, and then the countdown ended, a massive burst of energy rippled outward, destroying every ship and sterilizing every colony in the system."

anomalymod.109.desc:0 "Researchers on [Root.Capital.GetName] have eagerly anticipated the countdown of the mysterious atomic clock of prodigious precision found on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] for the past 42 years and 3 days.\n\nSeveral decades' worth of heated speculation and conjecture have evaporated in an instant: the clock has just now reached its momentous deadline. Unfortunately, the clock was in fact a bomb of unimaginable raw power, easily obliterating everything within three systems."
anomalymod.109.a:0 "Oh, the Humanity!"
anomalymod.109.a.tooltip:0 "Everything in the [atomic_clock_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System is obliterated. All ships and colonies within three jumps of the [atomic_clock_planet.Solar_System.GetName] System are destroyed"

anomalymod.116.name:0 "Angry Nanites"
anomalymod.116.desc:0 "Our bomb disposal unit can report with absolute confidence that the atomic clock is not a bomb. Unfortunately for Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], that is because the clock instead contained trillions of self-replicating nanites in hidden compartments. Everyone on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] died when the gray goo consumed the asteroid."
anomalymod.117.name:0 "Clock Diffused"
anomalymod.117.desc:0 "Our bomb disposal team has clipped every wire they could, disabling the atomic clock. Further analysis of the remains have not turned up any evidence of an explosive device of any kind, but they did reveal hidden chambers filled with self-replicating nanites. The purpose of these nanites are unknown."
anomalymod.117.a:0 "Those nanites could have been dangerous..."
anomalymod.118.desc:0 "Our bomb disposal team has clipped every wire they could, disabling the atomic clock. Further analysis of the remains have revealed a powerful explosive device concealed in a hidden compartment. If it has been allowed to detonate, it could have destroyed everything in the system, and perhaps beyond."
anomalymod.118.a:0 "It won't destroy anything now."
anomalymod.119.name:0 "The Red Wire"
anomalymod.119.desc:0 "The atomic clock on [atomic_clock_planet.GetName] was indeed the timing unit of a bomb. Unfortunately, the bomb disposal unit clipped the wrong wire, detonating the bomb early."

anomalymod.122.name:0 "It Came from Outer Space"
anomalymod.122.desc:0 "The spaceborn insects have decended on [Root.GetName], devouring every plant in sight. Our people are helpless to stop the billions of arthropods despoiling their homes. It is only a matter of time before the entire planet is consumed."
anomalymod.123.name:0 "Devastation"
anomalymod.123.desc:0 "The ravenous swarms have left [Root.GetName], leaving behind not a single leaf, straw or flower. The insects have no doubt left to find more worlds to consume, caring not for the destruction they leave in their wake."
anomalymod.123.a:0 "They must be stopped!"
anomalymod.124.name:0 "Spaceborn Insects"
anomalymod.124.a.desc:0 "Our sensors have detected a massive swarm of spaceborn locusts entering the [From.solar_system.GetName] System, the same planet-devouring insects that we have encountered before. Their passage through our space is an ill-omen for the [Root.GetName]."
anomalymod.124.b.desc:0 "Our sensors have detected a massive swarm of spaceborn insects entering the [From.solar_system.GetName] System, of a species we have never encountered before. These creatures should be studied to determine any potential benifit or threat to the [Root.GetName]."
anomalymod.124.a:0 "What do they want?"
anomalymod.125.desc:0 "Although they are spaceborn lifeforms, the insects that entered our system appear to prefer a plant-based died. Disturbingly, they are such voracious eaters that they could protentially strip entire planet of life, if allowed to make planetfall."
anomalymod.125.a:0 "We need to find a way to keep them off our worlds."
anomalymod.126.desc:0 "Studies of the spaceborn locusts have revealed them to be tenacious eaters and rapid breeders, and once they make planetfall, there is little that can keep them from the planet's biomass short of a complete nuclear bombardment of the planet's surface. Any planet that they are currently devouring is lost to us.\n\nFortunately, there are ways to stop the insects from reaching the surface at all. A planetary-wide shield will prevent the locusts from decending upon a planet, and eventually they will become restless and leave for greener pastures."
anomalymod.126.a:0 "We must build shield generators on our worlds."
anomalymod.126.b:0 "We must research this technology."

anomalymod.200.name:0 "Methane Biosphere"
anomalymod.200.desc:0 "Although toxic to most forms of known life, §Y[From.GetName]§! supports a thriving ecology within the high pressure of its atmosphere. Life here uses methane instead of water as a solvent, and has developed in ways that differ significantly from previously established ecological models. Its study would greatly benefit our knowledge of xeno biology."
anomalymod.201.name:0 "Aerostat Mines"
anomalymod.201.desc:0 "A ruined network of aerostat mining facilities dating back several millennia can be found in low orbit of this gas giant. It appears to have been utilized to extract rare gases from [FROM.GetName]'s atmosphere, which scans indicate are still abundant. They have been abandoned and reoccupied by many different races and pirate groups since, with the most recent occupation dating back several hundred years.\n\nDespite their advanced age, the mining facilities are in remarkably good condition, and can be occupied and repaired with minimal effort."
anomalymod.202.name:0 "Crashed Colony Ship"
anomalymod.202.desc:0 "A large colony ship plowed into the surface of this asteroid millennia ago, creating a shallow canyon. The bulk of the remains consist of cyrogenic chambers, where presumably the colonists would sleep during their ill-fated journey. There is no visible cockpit on the ship, leading our scientists to believe it was piloted through some kind of artificial intelligence. Although it is too damaged to be salvaged, the ship hasn't been picked clean by looters yet, allowing us a chance to study the remains."
anomalymod.203.name:0 "Kinetic Weapons Testing"
anomalymod.203.desc:0 "Several massive crater on [From.GetName] appears to be the result of an extremely powerful kinetic weapon. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] believes that [From.GetName] was being used as a testing ground for a weapon that could potentially destroy entire planets - a goal that, if the damage to [From.GetName] is any indication, was close to being achieved."
anomalymod.204.name:0 "Extinction Event"
anomalymod.204.desc:0 "Fossilized remains of microbial life can be found scattered across [From.GetName], revealing that the planet was once habitable. It appears that the the planet collided with a massive planetoid at least a billion years ago, striking with such force that [From.GetName] nearly broke in half. The cataclysmic event stripped the planet of its atmosphere and oceans, dooming the microbes to extinction."
anomalymod.206.name:0 "Prison Planet"

anomalymod.208.desc:0 "This asteroid appears to not be native to the [From.solar_system.GetName] System. Rather, given its differing composition and highly eccentric orbit, it appears to be a captured asteroid from another star system.\n\nInterestingly, it has a much higher mineral content than its neighboring asteroids, suggesting that its host system has a high metalicity. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has expressed an interest in finding this system, and has prepared a special project to track this asteroid back to where it came from."
anomalymod.209.a.desc:0 "Science Officer [asteroid_leader.GetName] has completed [asteroid_leader.GetHerHis] calculations regarding the extrasolar asteroid, and has traced it back to its system of origin. It appears to have originally come from the [host_system.GetName] System."
anomalymod.209.c.desc:0 "Science Officer [asteroid_leader.GetName] has completed [asteroid_leader.GetHerHis] calculations regarding the extrasolar asteroid. Unfortunately, [From.From.GetName]'s path through interstellar space was wild and chaotic, and Science Officer [asteroid_leader.GetName] lost its trail somewhere in a nearby nebula.\n\nScience Officer [asteroid_leader.GetName]'s efforts were not completely in vain, however. [asteroid_leader.GetSheHeCap] developed some innovative new techniques during [asteroid_leader.GetHerHis] search that our scientists back on [Root.Owner.Capital.GetName] have used to improve our sensor technologies."
anomalymod.209.d.desc:0 "Science Officer [asteroid_leader.GetName] has completed [asteroid_leader.GetHerHis] calculations, but the asteroid's system of origin wasn't what was expected. It appears that the star system went supernova hundreds of millions of years ago, which is likely what kicked the asteroid into interstellar space. There's nothing left in its host system worth exploiting, but there could be more extrasolar asteroids out there, waiting to be discovered."

This world collided with another planetoid millions of years ago, sending bits of the planet flying into interstellar space. Scans of the planet show it is rich with minerals, which are readily accessable in its broken state."
anomalymod.212.desc:0 "We have found another extrasolar asteroid, which remarkably appears to have been ejected from the same supernova as the previous such asteroid we discovered. This confirms previous suspicions that the supernova could have ejected asteroids all across this region of space."
anomalymod.213.desc:0 "After continued studies of the massive skeletal remains found on [From.From.GetName], Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has concluded that the remains belonged to a massive spaceborn entity. The creature appeared to have been capable of interstellar travel, although its means of doing so are not well preserved.\n\nThe most fascinating discovery comes from the composition of the creature's bones. They are heavily reinforced with §HLiving Metal§!, an extremely rare inorganic material with surprising regenerative properties. Over billions of years, the metal has fused into extremely dense deposits, that could protentially be mined for millennia to come."

anomalymod.216.desc:0 "Intensive study of the residual energy readings on [transdimensional_being_planet.GetName] has revealed several key insights, allowing our scientists to develop a tentitive theoretical model of the dimensional gate. Strangely, this gateway appears to have required more energy than our universe should be able to supply, implying that the dimension it was built in ran on very different laws of physics.\n\nRemarkably, despite their highly disparate origins, the energy readings observed on [transdimensional_being_planet.GetName] show a striking similarity to the harmonics observed in the mysterious §HL-Gates§!! Analyzing these signals in conjunction with other insights into the ancient Gateway Builders, may yield valuable data on how these L-Gates could be reactivated."

anomalymod.219.name:0 "Hidden Gateway"
anomalymod.219.a.desc:0 "Asteroid [From.GetName] is not an asteroid at all, but rather an artificial shell surrounding an ancient space station. The strong residual subspace signature that surrounds the station indicates that it may be a '§HGateway§!' of sorts - part of a theoretical network of similar stations that at some point would have allowed for near-instantaneous travel between different parts of the galaxy.\n\nAssuming this is a Gateway, its current state of disrepair has rendered it unusable. If it could be restored into working order, its owner would potentially be able to access any other functional gateways in the galaxy, enabling travel across huge distances in a matter of days."

anomalymod.220.desc:0 "Scans of [From.GetName] showed the [From.GetPlanetMoon] to be fairly standard, but Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] did report some unusual alien lifeforms. In particular, they discovered a species of docile, brightly colored herbivores that uses gas filled sacks to gently float across the ground. These 'Gas Bags,' as they have come to be called, feed off of the native leaves and grasses, and float into the treetops to nest.\n\n Despite being slow and clumsy, the native preditors rarely hunt them. As one of the crew discovered to their misfortune, the Gas Bags tend to explode violently when their sacks are ruptured, which is enough to discourage predation. Their explosive death throws aside, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] found that they are otherwise harmless, and are in fact quite friendly."
anomalymod.221.desc:0 "After identifying an anomaly in the gravity well of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] has discovered the shattered wreckage of an ancient ore superfreighter. It appears to have been attacked by pirates, and then stripped of anything valuable. Although it is too damaged to be salvaged, enough of it remains intact that we could study its design."

anomalymod.222.desc:0 "The wreckage on [From.GetName], originally thought to be from a fleet of warships, are in fact from one massive battleship, bigger than anything the [Root.Owner.GetName] has ever seen. Its main gun alone rivals an entire [Root.Owner.GetName] fleet, and its armor is barely dented even after crashing into [From.GetName]. It shows signs of many battles, but none of the damage is severe enough to bring down such a titanic ship. Instead, it appears to have contained a flaw in its power core. Repeated stress on the system caused the core to rupture, ripping the ship apart from the inside."

anomalymod.223.desc:0 "Amazingly, while conducting their survey of [From.GetName], the crew of the [Root.GetName] picked up several life signs coming from within the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. Colonies of rock and sulfer eating microbes cling to life deep below the surface.

[From.GetName] was drying out, and the natives built these canals to bring water from the poles, the only major source of water left. Unfortunately they were unable to stop [From.GetName] slow death, and went extinct with the rest of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s biosphere.\n\nWhile much of their technology is primitive by our standards, their farming and irrigation techniques were quite advanced, and Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has drawn up several ways they could be used to benifit the [Root.Owner.GetName]."

These coral-like entities filter out rare gases from [From.From.GetName]'s thin atmosphere and concentrate them in specialized interior structures of the crystal shells. These gases, which had previously been overlooked, react with the crystals to produce strong electrical discharges, which the lifeforms then seem to feed upon. By investigating where the crystals are most numerous, [Root.GetLeaderName] has uncovered a massive well of rare gases located deep under [From.From.GetName]."

Unfortunately, our research laboratories are not in great shape, and are currently tied up in other, equally urgent work. Would you be willing to lend us your facilities to study the beast?"
colonyexpanded.506.desc.robot:0 "Status update: live Warp beast specimen recovered. Analysis: specimen can be studied for potential weaknesses. Calculator research capacity: 47% of optimal. Research capacity insufficient for effective analysis of specimen. Requesting temporary use of calculator units."

colonyexpanded.507.name:0 "Warp Beast Study"
colonyexpanded.507.desc:0 "Our researchers have concluded an extensive study on the Warp beasts specimen provided from the mirror universe. The creature is terrifying to look at, seemingly composed of nothing but teeth and claws, and ravenously devours any matter that gets too close to any of its many mouth parts. As described in field reports from the mirror universe, the Warp beast's hide forms a natural armor that is highly resistant to weapon damage, and its mouths produce a highly acidic saliva that it uses as a potent weapon.\n\nA major breakthrough was made when the beast was moved to one of our secure facilities for a sensitive experiment. After passing through the dimensional portal, it soon became docile, acting with confusion at its new environment. Our researchers speculate that since we use hyperdrives, our universe lacks the characteristic warp signatures that woke the beasts in the mirror universe. Once we uncovered the biological mechanisms responsible for detecting subspace signatures, we were able to construct a device capable of distrupting these sensory organs, rendering the beasts temporarily disoriented. Used tactically, such a device could be devastating against Warp beast fleets. The only limitation is the massive power requirements, meaning it can only be equiped on large ships.\n\nOur counterparts in the mirror universe are delighted with our results, and have already begun constructing specially-designed ships for deployment against the Warp beasts."
colonyexpanded.507.a.tooltip:0 "Our mirror selves will be better able to fight off the Warp beasts."
colonyexpanded.508.desc:0 "Greetings, [Root.Owner.Leader.GetName]. I had hoped to propose an exchange between our two nations. As the war with the warp beasts drags on, our supply of exotic gases have begun to dwindle. Our military requires large quantities of these gases to make plasma weaponry, which we have discovered to be the most effective weapons to use against the Warp beasts. If you could supply us with a large sum of exotic gases, we would be willing to give you access to our plasma technology in exchange."
colonyexpanded.508.desc.robot:0 "Status update: exotic gas supply 38% of optimal. Exotic gases required for plasma weaponry, most effective weapons available against the Warp beasts. Requesting transfer of exotic gases, offering plasma technology in exchange."

colonyexpanded.509.desc:0 "Greetings, [Root.Owner.Leader.GetName]. The [Root.GetName] has a request to make. Since the Warp beasts first appeared in our space, we have focused our resources almost entirely on our military. Understandably, our domestic sectors have stagnated as a result. If you could provide some consumer goods, it would do wonders for morale."

colonyexpanded.510.desc:0 "Greetings, [Root.Owner.Leader.GetName]. We have a request to make of you. Our science officer [dead_portal_leader.GetName] was conducting experimental weapons research, but was killed when Warp beasts attacked [dead_portal_leader.GetHerHis] facility. We managed to recover much of [dead_portal_leader.GetHerHis] research, but our scientists are having trouble deciphering [dead_portal_leader.GetHerHis] work.\n\nWe understand that [dead_portal_leader.GetName] is still alive in your universe. We would greatly appreciate if [dead_portal_leader.GetSheHe] could look at our research. We would be willing to send samples of Warp beast carapaces for you to experiment on."

countryexpanded.1.desc:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! I have been asked to approach you on behalf of the Baldarak Science Academy about a matter we hope you can help with. We have been pondering possibilities for the future, and many in the Science Academy have expressed concerns over some future hostile race doing harm to us, as they did to Tollok Rong. As much as we appreciate your rescue, we cannot have our future be at the mercy of benevolent solids.\n\nWe would like to develop a means to protect ourselves from any future unpleasantness. Sadly, the Science Academy does not have the technology to study the matter properly. If you'd be so kind, could you send one of your science ships to Tollok Rong?"
countryexpanded.1.a:0 "Very well."
countryexpanded.1.a.response:0 "Excellent! Our scientists will fill you in on what they're looking for."

countryexpanded.3.desc:0 "Thank you, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! The amount of data you collected is beyond our wildest expectations. With this we should be able to get a clear model of precisely how Tollok Rong was poisoned, and from there we can figure out ways to prevent it.\n\nWe couldn't have done this without you. Please allow us to share our findings with you. We hope they will be of use."

countryexpanded.4.desc:0 "Hello again, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], on behalf of the Baldarak Science Academy. We have been trying to develop protective systems using the data you acquired for us from Tollok Rong, but we have become bogged down in calculations. You solids have rather advanced calculation machines, I've come to understand. It it's not too much to ask, could the Science Academy borrow access to them? It would hasten our research immensely."

Oh, I'm going to have nightmares about this for the rest of my days. \n\nI'm sorry, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], that wasn't meant to happen. We'll have to develop something else. We will contact you when we have a new prototype ready."
countryexpanded.8.a:0 "Very well."
countryexpanded.9.desc:0 "Greetings! We have perfected a new prototype for you to try. We have high hopes for this. If all goes well, it should protect us from all sorts of nastyness. Assuming the ventral nanowave modulator doesn't... nevermind, not important. We've picked out another world to try it on, if we could borrow a science ship."

countryexpanded.10.desc:0 "With some trepidation, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] turned the Dathnak's prototype device on [dathnak_test_planet_2.GetName]. To everyone's amazement, the gas giant disappeared under a sickly green shield. Repeated testing showed the shield to be impenetrable."
countryexpanded.11.desc:0 "Marvelous! It all went well above expectations. And it didn't even catch fire! Of course now we need to find a way to turn it off, but we can cross that jet stream when we come to it. Here, let us send you a copy of all our research. Perhaps you can use it to protect your own worlds from fiery armageddon."
countryexpanded.11.a:0 "Happy we could be of assistance"
countryexpanded.11.a.response:0 "We should have our final prototype ready soon. Keep safe, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
countryexpanded.12.desc:0 "Greetings, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! The Baldarak Science Academy has been hard at work improving our prototype, and they have finally developed a design they are satisfied with. We have one final test we need your help."

Industrial pollutants have drastically changed our planet's climate, sparking a mass extinction event the likes of which had not been seen in millions of years.\n\nAlthough we have tried to adapt our society so as to not damage §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! further, many fear that we are living on borrowed time.

countryexpanded.30.desc:0 "The hyperlanes were not our first attempt at faster-than-light travel. Over a century ago, an unstable wormhole was discovered beyond the Oort Cloud, just barely within reach with the current technologies. Excited at the possibilities, the United Nations sponsered the Ulysses Initiative to study the wormhole, and to develop a means to traverse it.\n\nIn 2087, the Ulysses Initiative managed to send an unmanned probe to the [colony_system_2.GetName] System, transmitting back to Earth for the first time a view of an alien world. Bolstered by a wave of popular support, within two decades a half-dozen ark ships carrying a quarter million colonists each braved the wormhole in search of a new home.\n\nNone were ever heard from again. A few days after the last ark ship went through, the wormhole collapsed in on itself and disappeared, but not before spitting up half of one of the missing ark ships. This brought an end to the Ulysses Initiative, and halted FTL research until the discovery of the hyperlanes decades later. Most humans have long forgotten the lost ark ships, but some still wonder if they might still be out there, somewhere."

The Ulysses Initiative sent several unmanned probes to test their wormhole technology, but it was the probe to this System that is most remembered. It was here that Humanity caught its first glimpse of what might have been a habitable world beyond Sol. Named Elpis after the Greek personification of hope, our scans have confirmed what the Ulysses Initiative could only have suspected: a planet hospitable to human life. If any of the colony ships have survived, it will be here."

countryexpanded.33.f.desc:0 "We have found evidence that the Persea successfully managed to land on Elpis and found the beginings of a colony there. However, the soil was much poorer in nuitrients than expected, and the colonists had trouble producing enough food. This eventually lead to civil strife and food riots that tore the fledgling colony apart."

Unfortunately, the planet is host to an invasive fungal lifeform of unknown origin, which blankets the entire biosphere.\n\nAny future settlers on the planet would have to deal with routinely burning back the exofungus - it is unknown at this point if it can be entirely eradicated. Without any means of doing so, the fungus overran the colony. The final fate of the original colonists remain unknown."

They appear to be energy-based, much like the beings operating them, and have massive shields with impressive regenerative properties. Beneath those shields, however, their ships are very vulnerable, possessing no significant armor whatsoever. They are armed with unique weapons which our scientists have dubbed 'Matter Disintegrators,' as they seem to be especially effective against physical defenses such as armor and hull.\n\nAccompanying the main fleet are a number of small constructor fleets, which have been busying themselves constructing space stations in Unbidden controlled space. The purpose of these space stations are currently unknown, although there is some speculation that they might be strenghtening the interdimensional tear, keeping it stable."

megaexpanded.8.desc:0 "Our sensor array has recently detected an extremely weak tachyon signal. Our technicians are unable to trace the signal to its source, as it is being bounced between several hidden relay stations. The signal originally seemed to be acting as a call and response system, pinging targeted systems and waiting for a response. This behavior has since changed, and the unidentified source is now transmitting a low level signal indescriminately throughout the galaxy.\n\nAside from adding a small amount of background noise in FTL transmissions on certain subspace frequencies, the signal does not seem to have any apparent effect. Efforts to track the relay stations are underway, but until then we may simply have to learn to live with this strange signal."
megaexpanded.8.desc.b:0 "Our sensor array has recently detected an extremely weak tachyon signal. At first the signal exibited a call and response protocol, but it has since started broadcasting a low level signal across the galaxy between multiple hidden relay stations. Aside from adding a small amount of background noise in FTL transmissions on certain subspace frequencies, the signal has no apparent effect or purpose.\n\nWe have commenced tracking protocols to locate its source, but as of yet, the signal is too weak. We may not have to wait much longer though, as it is growing in strength at an alarming rate."

megaexpanded.11.desc:0 "Our sensor array has managed to get several good scans of the ships being produced by the sterilization hubs. Their ships are heavily armored and shielded, but beneath these defenses their base hull is relatively fragile. Their ships are armed with powerful laser weapons, while the ai cores defending their hubs are augmented with seeker drone strike craft.\n\nOur scans have also confirmed that the sterilization hubs are the sources of the tachyon signal. By disabling these worlds, we should be able to weaken the signal significantly."
