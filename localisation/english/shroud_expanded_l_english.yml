Massive currents of raw psionic energy is funneled through here, sometimes giving violent birth to semi-intelligent spiritual apparitions.\n\nThese confused spirits often clash with one another, unleashing massive amounts of psychic power in battles that can last millennia. In fact, several such duels seem to be taking place right now.\n\nWe should proceed with caution."

Incredible spires rise towards the sky, aided by anti-grav technology generations beyond our own. The current takes us into such a spire, through wall after wall until we reach a large spaceport of sorts with some empty ships porting within it. The main entrance of spaceport is guarded by two [fallen_empire.GetSpeciesNamePlural], floating comfortably in zero-gravity chairs with heavy armfire while conversing with each other in soft voices.\n\nThey are oblivious to our presence."

We must...§!\n\nThe two were arguing fiercely, provided a precious opportunity for our psionics to concentrate on the ship.

Above them,  the giant fallen empire spaceship is floating silently right next to our capital, awaiting our orders."

Someone is watching."§!\n\nTheir eyes search the room until both of them are staring directly at us.\n\n§H"Remarkable.
