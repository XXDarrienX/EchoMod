pdmushroom.10.name:0 "A Strange Discovery"
pdmushroom.10.desc:0 "We have received a report from the [Root.GetName] which is currently in the [Root.GetStarName] System. One of the planets seems to be surrounded by large aggressive voidborne creatures. While we can't get close enough for a thorough sweep, it's clear that the planet has an abundance of mycelial life."
pdmushroom.10.a:0 "Interesting."
pdmushroom.20.name:0 "A Connected World"
pdmushroom.20.desc:0 "Now that [Root.GetLeaderName] has been able to run a complete scan of the planet, we can give a more detailed report. While correct in nature, our initial estimate of the amount of mycelial life did not do the planet justice. Many interconnected networks cover the entire surface, most existing in a symbiotic state with each other. These mushrooms would be both an abundant food source and a great boon for biologists."
pdmushroom.20.a:0 "Amazing."

pdmushroom.30.name:0 "Harmless Fun"
pdmushroom.30.desc:0 "Vague reports have been coming in about the ingestion of a particular strain of mushroom on the planet. It seems to have hallucinogenic qualities and is being used recreationally. So far no addictions have been documented and most people report feelings more connected to both nature and their fellow citizens after using the Shrooms."
pdmushroom.30.a:0 "Just some harmless fun."
pdmushroom.30.a.tooltip:0 "We allow the usage to continue."
pdmushroom.30.b:0 "There could be side effects."
pdmushroom.30.b.tooltip:0 "We make it illegal."
pdmushroom.31.name:0 "Legalize It"
pdmushroom.31.desc:0 "Allowing the mushroom to be consumed has been an interesting experience for the colony. Using Shrooms has moved from a fringe recreational pastime to being commonplace in many parts of the colony's society. People use it for a multiple of reasons and different groups have reported various claims about it's abilities. While some swear by it ability to boost strength, others claim it improves intelligence and memory. The few tests to verify these claims have come back inconclusive and not one test has proven there to be any side effects other than people's happiness. While some of our more conservative citizens are calling for a ban, most people seem content to leave it be."
pdmushroom.31.a:0 "No harm, no foul."
pdmushroom.31.a.tooltip:0 "We allow the usage to continue."
pdmushroom.31.b:0 "This sounds too good to be true."
pdmushroom.31.b.tooltip:0 "We make it illegal."
pdmushroom.32.name:0 "A Change in Us All"
pdmushroom.32.desc:0 "Using Shrooms has now become wide spread to the point it is used quite regularly by a majority of the colony. Further testing has shown that there indeed seems to be a slight genetic change in the colonist who use Shrooms regularly. We're not sure exactly how the Shrooms are causing this mutation and what would happen if left unchecked. Our scientists seem quite excited to explore the possibilities that this revelation opens up but many citizens are calling for the mushroom usage to be stopped once and for all."
pdmushroom.32.a:0 "It's a personal choice, what could happen?"
pdmushroom.32.a.tooltip:0 "We allow the usage to continue."
pdmushroom.32.b:0 "This is troubling, stop it at once."
pdmushroom.32.b.tooltip:0 "We make it illegal."
pdmushroom.32.c:0 "Let's learn everything we can from it."
pdmushroom.32.c.tooltip:0 "We dedicate resources to unlocking the mystery of these Shrooms."
pdmushroom.33.name:0 "A Spore From The Past"
pdmushroom.33.desc:0 "The mushroom's genetic code is beyond anything we could have ever imagined. From what we can tell, it appears the Shrooms are actually the spores of a long dead race of fungoid people who seemed to procreate by slowly changing their hosts into their race. It was quite lucky we caught it when we did, if this had been left to continue unchecked, we estimate the colony would have begun 'turning' into some  kind of hybrid creature within a few years. Our scientists have successfully stopped the process planetwide with a simple inoculation and there doesn't appear to be any further danger. They have also been able to isolate the genes that improve strength and intelligence and are confident that we could introduce these genes into our population without any side effects. Regardless this unique discovery has greatly enhanced our knowledge of genetics."
pdmushroom.33.a:0 "Our people can only get better."
pdmushroom.33.a.tooltip:0 "We start a project to add the mushroom genes into our population."
pdmushroom.33.b:0 "We're fine just the way we are."
pdmushroom.33.b.tooltip:0 "We add this knowledge into our databanks."
pdmushroom.34.name:0 "A Sprouted People"
pdmushroom.34.desc:0 "The project was a complete success, the genes took to our genetic code better than expected. So far we have seen no negative reprecussion from any citizens."
pdmushroom.34.a:0 "Excellent."
pdmushroom.40.name:0 "Prohibition"
pdmushroom.40.desc:0 "It appears that our attempts to curb people using Shrooms has not had the desired effect. Usage appears to be on the rise and gathering information on the criminal organization distributing the Shrooms has proven to be surprisingly hard. There are wild rumors that a secretive doomsday cult may be behind the distribution but there is little to no evidence to prove that this is true."
pdmushroom.40.a:0 "This is a problem for the local authorities."
pdmushroom.40.a.tooltip:0 "We allow local authorities to deal with this criminal element."
pdmushroom.40.b:0 "Let them know they have the government's support."
pdmushroom.40.b.tooltip:0 "We allocate extra funds to support the Shroom ban."
pdmushroom.41.name:0 "A Terrorist Attack"
pdmushroom.41.desc:0 "Reports are coming in about a terrorist attack on [Root.GetName] today. A suicide bomber entered a colonial government building late at night and detonated a device. A group calling themselves the Children of Spore have claimed responsibility for the attack and are demanding that Shrooms, which they call ‘The Godspore', be immediately made legal and available to every citizen on the planet. They are also demanding to keep the Godspore natural and pure, proposing any and all experimentation or regulations on it be made illegal and prohibited."
pdmushroom.41.a:0 "We don't negotiate with terrorists."
pdmushroom.41.a.tooltip:0 "We let local authorities deal with this issue."
pdmushroom.41.b:0 "Stop them before they try anything else."
pdmushroom.41.b.tooltip:0 "We allocate more funds to fight terrorism on the planet."
pdmushroom.41.c:0 "No more bloodshed, give them what they want."
pdmushroom.41.c.tooltip:0 "We give in to the demands of the Cult to broker a peace."
pdmushroom.42.name:0 "And the Air Grew Thick"
pdmushroom.42.desc:0 "Children of Spore Cultists have organized another attack on [Root.GetName]. The sophisticated operation involved bio-bombs that released extremely dense levels of Godspores into the most populated areas of the colony and the population are being advised to stay indoors. While there are currently only a relatively few cases of health issues, it is unknown what long term effects this will have on the colony."
pdmushroom.42.a:0 "What are they trying to accomplish?"
pdmushroom.42.a.tooltip:0 "We attempt to clean up the mess they've made."
pdmushroom.43.name:0 "Strange Bedfellows"
pdmushroom.43.desc:0 "The Children of the Spore have begun an aggressive campaign to highlight the benefits of using Godspore. Hundreds of localized projects have been introducing it into the atmosphere and water systems. There isn't a citizen on [GETNAME] who does not have high levels of Godspore present in their bloodstream. There have been no reported health issues. but due the the research ban we have no way to know how this might be affecting people."
pdmushroom.43.a:0 "I hope we made the right choice."
pdmushroom.43.a.tooltip:0 "The Children of the Spore continue with their work."
pdmushroom.44.name:0 "Attack of the Shrooms"
pdmushroom.44.desc:0 "People on the planet have begun to experience radical changes in physiology. They are slowly being changed into a mutated fungal-hybrid and these beings are attacking the colony!"

pdmushroom.45.name:0 "Out of the Fire"
pdmushroom.45.desc:0 "We have successfully defended against the mutated citizens and we have immediately started to inoculate citizens to the spores. It will take time but we will eradicate this strain of mushroom on the planet. Our science teams are busy dissecting the mutants to learn everything we can to avoid this ever happening again."
pdmushroom.45.a:0 "What a horrible situation."
pdmushroom.46.name:0 "Radio Silence"
pdmushroom.46.desc:0 "We've lost all official communication with the colony. The mutated mushroom-hybrids are rampaging through the colony. Many colonists have gone into hiding or are on the run from the horde of creatures. We need to send troops immediately to help before it's too late."
pdmushroom.46.a:0 "Alert the generals."
pdmushroom.47.name:0 "Freedom"
pdmushroom.47.desc:0 "Our forces have regained control of [FromFrom.GetName]. Although most of the mutated colonists were violent it appears that this was not a guaranteed fate for our citizens. Some seem quite intelligent and have retained their memories of their previous lives. Furthermore, they have expressed a desire to continue being part of the colony. We have no way to know if they will eventually turn violent, but must decide the fate of these mutated citizens."
pdmushroom.47.a:0 "They were once our people, they are welcome."
pdmushroom.47.b:0 "They turned on us once they can do it again."
pdmushroom.48.name:0 "It's Done"
pdmushroom.48.desc:0 "We have roundup the rest of the mutated mushroom-hybrids and disposed of them. Our xenobiologists are busy studying what they can and how to protect our people from ever recurring again."
pdmushroom.48.a:0 "We stand ever vigilant to protect our people."
pdmushroom.50.name:0 "That's That"
pdmushroom.50.desc:0 "Our crackdown on Shrooms has been a success and we haven't heard any reports of usage for months. Local authorities are quite convinced there won't be any more issues with the Shrooms."
pdmushroom.50.a:0 "Good to hear."
pdmushroom.51.name:0 "That's That"
pdmushroom.51.desc:0 "Our efforts to stop the terrorists were successful. An elite squad successfully infiltrated their base and most of their leaders were killed or turned themselves in. Authorities are fairly confident this is the end of the cult."
pdmushroom.51.a:0 "We can all rest easy."
