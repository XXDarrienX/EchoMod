 reincarnate_rei_ayanami_DESC:0 "When The [Root.GetRulerTitle] decides it is time, she may reincarnate into a new, younger and healthier vessel. The decision is considered a joyous event, and is also the formal announcement of the three-month long Festival of Death and Rebirth to begin, each month representing birth, death, and rebirth respectively.\n\nAt the conclusion of the festival, Rei Ayanami will reincarnate refreshed, revitalized and although it borders on blasphemy to suggest such a thing: slightly changed.\n\n\n\nThis project can only be completed once every five years."
