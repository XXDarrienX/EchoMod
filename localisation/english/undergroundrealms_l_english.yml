An §Rundeniable truth§!...\nDuring our planar travels, we've seen both Past, Present and Future, subtly and inextricabily intertwined each other. We've seen the Dawn of Time... and the Cold Twilight of the Universe. We've seen civilizations rise and fall, the Birth of Heroes, and their Downfall, tired, exhausted, becoming eventually a mere shadow of their former Self, corrupted and faded.\nWe've seen the Ruin of Everything, we've seen the End of All.\nWe've witnessed this soft and subtle Truth, as a whole, crude, uncanny yet fantastic, and we stood, stoic, contemplating the Grand Design of Things, the unstoppable Journey to the Chilling Death of the Universe.\nHowever, the Shroud is the Realm of all Possibilities, where Space and Time merge.\nAs the Conclave was meditating during a Seance, thinking about those philosophical Truth and travelling into the Shroud, a §RPresence§!, far more powerful than any Shroud Entity we met, has approached us. In a strange fantasmagorical tone, It talks to us\n"§RI have been watching you§!, your §RTime§! has come.
