 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kilrathi_desc:1 "The Kilrathi are a cat like warrior race who inhabit the territories of the Empire of Kilrah. Kilrathi society is built upon honour and the strength of the individual. The society is incredibly class-based, with a nobility that holds absolute power over those below them. The necessity of responding to a challenge is an integral part of Kilrathi society. Any insult or challenge can be considered the grounds for a struggle to the death. It is, in fact, punishable by death for a warrior in the Kilrathi military to back down from single combat. Through challenge, the Kilrathi dominant/submissive relationship is established. Combat is a way of life for the Kilrathi, so don't expect to be friends."
