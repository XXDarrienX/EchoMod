 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans3_desc:0 "The world collapsed with economic and political ruin, wars started over petty disputes, but one nation was left ignored thought, and when the world was left in darkness, the island nation went out to reclaim what it lost. The Dominions united with them, and then, the world bent its knees to them, once again, The British Empire ruled the international stage, and then they set their eyes to the sky, to conquer for Queen and Empire. The Sun Never set on the British Empire, and in space, it never shall."
