  EMPIRE_DESIGN_krogan_desc:0 "Krogan are large reptilian bipeds native to the planet Tuchanka, a world known for its harsh and dangerous environments. The harsh homeworld conditioned the krogan psychology for toughness just as it did the body. Krogan have always had a tendency to be selfish, xenophobe, and violent. They respect strength and self-reliance and are neither surprised nor offended by treachery. The weak and selfless do not live long in their society.\n\nThe salarians "uplifted" the krogan into galactic society to lent their numbers and military prowess in order to defeat the Rachni. Ironically, after the war, the rapidly-expanding krogan became a threat to the galaxy in turn, starting the Krogan Rebellions and forcing the turians to unleash the genophage. The genophage, a genetic "infection" dramatically reduced fertility in krogan females, causing a severe drop in births."

Famed for their incredible strength, durability and adaptibility, krogan who don't perish in battle or some other unnatural means can live upwards of 1000 years. Unfortunately their martial focus has weakened their scientific acumen, and their combative nature makes them difficult to control."
