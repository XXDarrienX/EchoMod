 star_lifter_0:0 "Star Lifter Site"
 star_lifter_0_DESC:0 "This site will one day provide our empire with  several planets worth of minerals."
 star_lifter_1:0 "Star Lifter Frame"
 star_lifter_1_DESC:0 "This slender frame will one day support a mining complex that will blot out the systems star, and our mineral shortage."
 star_lifter_2:0 "Star Lifter Stage 1"
 star_lifter_2_DESC:0 "At this stage of completion this Star Lifter is producing about 25% of its potential yield."
 star_lifter_3:0 "Star Lifter Stage 2"
 star_lifter_3_DESC:0 "At this stage of completion this Star Lifter is producing about 50% of its potential yield."
 star_lifter_4:0 "Star Lifter Stage 3"

 star_lifter_5_DESC:0 "This Star Lifter is fully operational. It is currently producing astronomical amounts of minerals."
 
 starlifter.1.name:0 "Starlifter Construction"
 starlifter.1.desc:0 "Harnessing the power of the stars has been a dream of [Root.GetAdj] engineers throughout history - from crude combustion to the pale imitation of solar fusion - and we now stand ready to realize this dream. In the [From.From.GetName] system sits the scaffold upon which we will build a Star Lifter, encompassing [From.From.GetName] and monopolizing the cataclysmic power of the star."
 starlifter.1.a:0 "Boundless"
 starlifter.3.name:0 "Alien Megastructure"
 starlifter.3.desc.a:0 "Frenetic activity in the [star_lifter_system.GetName] system betrays the construction of a §HStar Lifter§! by the [From.GetName].\n\nStill in its early stages, the completed sphere will eventually blot out the light of [star_lifter_system.GetName], its radiance diverted to [From.GetAdj] mineral stores."
 starlifter.3.a:0 "All stellar powers must eventually tame the stars."
 starlifter.4.name:0 "Star Lifter Framebuilt"
 starlifter.4.desc:0 "With the frame now in place, the awesome scale of the project is evident to all.\n\n[From.From.GetName] burns in a spindly cage, but will eventually be completely surrounded by [Root.GetAdj] solar panels."
 starlifter.4.a:0 "Exquisite"
 starlifter.5.name:0 "Star Lifter Panels Installed"
 starlifter.5.desc:0 "While not yet complete, with the installation of advanced solar harvesters we have begun to reap the benefits of the Dyson Sphere being built in the [From.From.GetName] system.\n\nThe mineral gains will only continue to increase as construction continues, eventually reaching full operational capacity when the Sphere is completed."
 starlifter.5.a:0 "Excellent."
 starlifter.6.name:0 "[From.From.GetName] Star Lifter Completed"
 starlifter.6.desc:0 "The [From.From.GetName] system's primary has now been completely enveloped by a [Root.GetAdj] Star Lifter.\n\nOur engineers celebrate this as a great victory, and rightly so. We have achieved what only a handful of star empires in the history of the galaxy dared imagine - the total subjugation of a star."
 starlifter.7.name:0 "Alien Megastructure Completed"
 starlifter.7.desc:0 "The last detectable traces of light from the [From.From.From.GetName] system's star flicker out. The [From.GetName] has completed its Dyson Sphere, and a new void in the sky stands testament to [From.GetAdj] ingenuity and wealth."
