 pc_city_ruined:0 "Ruined Ecumenopolis"
 pc_city_ruined_desc:0 "World completely engulfed by desolate urban wasteland. Its natural lithosphere is no longer discernible from orbit. The atmospheric control systems are no longer filtering the toxins leaching out of ruined industrial sprawl."
 pc_city_molten:0 "Molten Ecumenopolis"
 pc_city_molten_desc:0 "World completely engulfed by incinerated urban wasteland. Its natural lithosphere has been ruptured, allowing lava to flow down once thriving thoroughfares. The geological compensation systems are totally out of control, slowly cracking the lithosphere apart." 
 
 ruec.1.name:0 "Ruined Ecumenopolis"
 ruec.1.a.desc:0 "Shining abnormally bright into space our ships have discovered a true wonder. A planet in [ruec_ruined_city_planet_1_system.GetName] appears to be totally engulfed by urban sprawl. One Megacity that stretches from pole to pole, a true ecumenopolis. Such a marvel of urban development requires mastery over every geological system, but judging by the decay of this world whatever controlled the weather and plate tectonics has long since ceased functioning. The industrial and commercial sectors have been picked clean, and what remains has slowly leached into the atmosphere leaving nothing but metal and concrete."
 ruec.1.b.desc:0 "Shining bright into space our ships have discovered an ecumenopolis. A planet in [ruec_ruined_city_planet_1_system.GetName] is at the pinnacle of urban development, equivalent to any world of our own. The weather control systems and geological compensation facilities appear to no longer function, and there are signs of devastating bombardment that reach all the way through the urban layers to the lithosphere beneath. The industrial systems have been looted and antimatter containment systems have been breached making the atmosphere unbreathable, nothing biological could survive for very long without advanced shielding. Whatever power once had control over this megacity has long since faded."
 ruec.1.c.desc:0 "Shining abnormally bright into space our ships have discovered an interesting world. A planet in [ruec_ruined_city_planet_1_system.GetName] appears to be totally engulfed by horrendous urban sprawl. One Megacity that smothers the natural beauty of a once perfectly habitable world. Such a waste of resources and a monument to endless greed this urban sprawl requires the destruction of every natural process, and constant unsustainable maintenance. Clearly whatever misguided power that abused and manipulated this world did not have the respect to clean up their mess."
 ruec.1.a:0 "Ours will never be ruined!"
 ruec.1.b:0 "What a mess!"
 ruec.2.name:0 "Ecumenopolis Restored"
 ruec.2.desc:0 "The ruined ecumenopolis in [ruec_ruined_city_planet_1_system.GetName] has been fully restored. Crucial weather control systems and geological compensation facilities have been brought back to working condition. Antimatter containment facilities and geothermal extraction systems are now at full power. The atmosphere is breathable once more and the worlds vast structure is stable again. The arcologies and districts themselves stills contain the ruins of the old world but we are ready to start landing ships and start a new one."
 ruec.4.name:0 "Molten Ecumenopolis"
 ruec.4.a.desc:0 "Shining abnormally bright into space our ships have discovered a true wonder. A fiery planet in [ruec_molten_city_planet_1_system.GetName] appears to be covered in urban sprawl, slowly melting into an abnormally active lithosphere. One Megacity stretches from pole to pole, with lava flowing freely down once thriving urban lanes. Such a marvel of urban development requires mastery over every geological system, but judging by the destruction below whatever controlled plate tectonics has long since run rampant, ravaging the urban centers almost beyond repair. The industrial and commercial sectors have been incinerated long ago, leaving nothing but metal and concrete."
 ruec.4.b.desc:0 "Shining bright into space our ships have discovered an ecumenopolis. A fiery planet in [ruec_molten_city_planet_1_system.GetName] was at the pinnacle of urban development, equivalent to any world of our own before abnormally active tectonics began claiming it back. The geological compensation facilities have totally lost control, driving magma to the surface, incinerating everything biological and leaving the atmosphere unbreathable. The industrial systems have been looted and antimatter containment systems have been breached, helping rupture the surface of this volatile world. Whatever power once had control over this megacity clearly couldn't handle the maintenance."
