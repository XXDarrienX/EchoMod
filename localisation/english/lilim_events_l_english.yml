 eva.1008.desc:0 "Some of our researchers and generals have jointly submitted a proposal detailing the logistics and methods for deploying Evangelion Units on far away worlds.\n\nThe deployment of an Evangelion Unit is, even planetside, a daunting task. While powerful, these units are heavy, cumbersome and are mostly designed for defense. They require a team of engineers and scientists to monitor and control it's activity, plus a small regiment of psychiatrists to care for the pilots. Using specialized transports, mobile command centres and resupply craft, we will be able to keep a single Evangelion Unit active indefinitely.\n\nAfter finalizing the proposal, doing some more research and field testing, The [Root.GetName] will then be able to deploy Evangelion Units on other planets."
 eva.1008.a:0 "Excellent, begin work right now and spare no expense."
 eva.1008.b:0 "OK, but let's cut the psychiatrists, they're an unnecessary expense."
