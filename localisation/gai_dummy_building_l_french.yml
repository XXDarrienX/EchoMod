 zz_gai_dummy_building_desc:0 "This building prevents the AI (Including sector AI) from building useless buildings that it doesn't have the pop to run. Yes, it's okay that you can build this building. You need the ability to build it so that your sector AI can make use of it. It will automatically destroy when the AI needs another building and has fewer than 2 free jobs!"
