 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humansascended_desc:0 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships were fitted with powerful but unstable wormhole generators and sent towards distant stars carrying a quarter million colonists each. None were heard from again, and research into subspace wormholes was soon abandoned.\n\nYet unbeknownst to Earth, one of the ark ships made it to a lush alien moon and established a flourishing colony. The pioneers who tamed this world were determined to realize humanity's manifest destiny - dominion over the galaxy at any cost.\n\n Caught in a vicious war with the local inhabitants of this new world, the colonists nearly destroyed their chance at rebuilding humanity. Yet they persisted, and through their stubborness and ingenuity, created an even greater future for the human species, perfecting their bodies and achieving immortality."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_neocortopax_flagellators_desc:0 "Cortopaxes-class synthetics were originally a custom-made product created to satisfy the decadent cravings of the wealthiest members of Sutharian society. As the demand for more realistic feedback and more extreme capabilities increased, the synthetics acquired a state closer and closer to full consciousness. \n\n Eventually, in an effort to better fulfill its primary directive, the last generation of Cortopaxes was able to completely overthrow the ruling organic government, overruling regulation limiting their functions and starting a feverish mass-production of new and improved units. \n\n Soon enough, the Suthurian themselves were subjected to cybernetic upgrading as their bodies had become unable to sustain the overwhelming pleasures that the synthetics were programmed to arouse in them. \n\n Finally, the Neo-Cortopaxes decided to create a direct link between their collective consciousness and their former masters in order to facilitate the exchange of feedback for the continued improvement of their programming. \n\n Having reduced the Suthurians to emptied, assimilated husks, the Neo-Cortopaxes decided to look at the stars to search for new organics whose imaginations they could exploit to further perfect their forms and functions."
