  sr_ruins_desc:0 "These are rare sites showing traces of a former colony of an ancient spacefaring ruins. Time, weather and biosphere normally quickly destroy these kind of site. This site is a rare opportunity to learn more about the previous civilisations inhabiting the galaxy.However excavating the site requires a specific installation"

  sr_datacache:0 "Ancient Datacache"
  sr_datacache_desc:0 "Ancient datacaches are troves of advanced technological knowledge. They have been left behind by a precursor civilization. They require a specific installation to be read. PReliminary analysis shows they contains a huge amount of engineering data along with a holo-story depicting a hero named Shepard trying to fend off giant robotic space-squids destroying the galaxy. Apparently he failed. Reading more data requires specific equipement."
