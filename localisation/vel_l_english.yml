  EMPIRE_DESIGN_velutarian_desc: "After having discovered the means to travel between planets, the elves of §SSindram§! sent out their most hardy specimen on the first exploration missions. Having crash-landed on the mildly temperate, plains of §SVelutaria§!, a group of these survivng explorers went back to the old ways of their native home and developed an entirely separate culture.\n\nThey formed a society based on a moral code with distinct, but permeable social classes and the belief that goals are achieved with a spiritual form of guidance and acceptance of the unknown.\n\nNow that they have achieved space flight once again, these Velutarians are now searching out the ancestral home from which the descendants of a mellennium ago came from, whilst searching out the stars for other beings who may exist. In this endeavour they have thus far proven themselves to be fearless explorers to the abyss known as space."
  START_SCREEN_VEL: "After a millennia of exile on this planet, the descendants of §SSindram§! have separated completely from their former elven ways. Since we were a spiritual people to begin with, we started to expand our reach across §SVelutaria§!. After rediscovering technology once lost to us, we came across an old logbook that stated a planet called §SSindram§! and along with a Council who sent our ancesters here had no way to contact the original exploration team. The Velutarians began discussing the possibility of reconnecting with their ancestors who might still be alive on §SSindram§!, but with no way of knowing where their ancestral homeworld is located, they would need to search the stars for information.\n\nIn this time, the Velutarian's have been busy at work decrypting more of the logbook which enlightened our scientist to a technology known as Wormhole Gates, this in turn would give us an edge to exploring the far reaches of space. Thereby giving us a better chance of finding our lost ancestral homeworld.\n\nThe probability of success is difficult to estimate; but if we never search the chance of success is zero."
