 EMPIRE_DESIGN_evandari_desc:0 "The Evandari evolved on the southern plains of Qell.  They expanded slowly across the planet, but eventually they covered it to an extent that they risked destroying it.\n\nThrough cooperation they survived their technological adolescence, and inevitably these collective beliefs replaced all others. For generations now it has been the epitome of Evandarian society to serve readily for the betterment of all.\n\nNow that their self-destructive ways are behind them they stand together facing a galaxy divided and filled with competing beliefs."
 START_SCREEN_EVANDARI:0 "It has been a long journey for our species.  From the earliest known [GetSpeciesName] communities on the windy southern plains of [GetHomeWorldName] we have spread across the world.  There were setbacks, climate change and disasters that wiped out primitive communities, but eventually with technology we prospered.\n\nAs we grew, inefficiencies became a liability.  In time it became necessary to purge antiquated beliefs and bring order.  Some resisted at first; their inefficient, self-serving ways threatening themselves as well as the whole planet.  In the end though they either self-destructed or were brought into the fold for the good of all.\n\nSince Unification we have come far in a short time.  Our scientist have unlocked hyperspace and now the galaxy is open to us."
