# # #creating dummy country:

# # # if spiritualist it will create the "Holy Order of the Blade" (members called the Divine Blades)
# # # insert country into the comms list? and have it respond to your hails like the shroud but with an opinion modifier...?

# # # Special Project is issued to investigate these sightings 

# # # Finding the ancient sword

# # # Event chain where you are interacting with the holy order that was created as a result of the legendsword event chain 

# # # Finding an ancient tomb, it contains the body of the "tf_legendary_warrior" 
# # # Okay so the body is discovered some point much later into the game with the dating being to a very early period of you're empire's history 
# # # i.e. pre-spaceflight
# # ## Overall interesting approach of creating more colony events to keep your empire feeling alive

# # # I want this chain to eventually include various weird visions and events happening in the colony and so on

# # # Create an on_conquest event that if the planet is lost all of the planetary modifiers are removed 
# # # using the condition for original owner, reassign a planetary modifier that gives "Sacked Site" maluses to the planet 
# # # -> for when this planet is reconquered
